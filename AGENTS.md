## PROJECT: World Cup 2026 — arcade browser football game

NOTE ON NAMING: the user-facing DISPLAY name is "World Cup 2026" (header logo in
HomePage, seoConfig siteName/description, stadium hoarding text in render.ts). The
internal code CODENAME is still "PitchKick" — the engine class is `PitchKickGame`,
the file is `engine.ts`, and this doc uses "PitchKick" as the project codename.
Renaming display strings does NOT require renaming the class/files.

A FIFA-like top-down football game played in the browser vs the CPU. Fully
client-side, rendered on `<canvas>` with `requestAnimationFrame`. No backend
game state yet (no Stores/queries for gameplay).

### Game architecture
- FILE SPLIT (June 2026, domains 1-5 of a 10-domain analysis): the old monolith
  `engine.ts` (~2,834 lines) was split BY DOMAIN into pure/stateless modules.
  `engine.ts` now imports from them and is ~1,924 lines (just the stateful
  `PitchKickGame` class: loop, physics, input, AI, possession, match rules).
  New sibling files in `src/client/game/`:
  - `constants.ts` — ALL world scale/geometry/physics/gameplay tunables
    (FIELD_W, PX_PER_M, FIELD_H, M(), goal geom, PLAYER_R, BALL_R, BALL_VIS_SCALE,
    PLAYER_SCALE, GRAVITY/BOUNCE/CONTROL_HEIGHT, every *_SPEED, CONTROL_DIST,
    BALL_DECAY, CHARGE_FULL, KICK_BUFFER, MATCH_*_SECS, ACCEL, TURN_RATE,
    HAIR_COLORS, SKIN_TONES, CANVAS_W/H). Import-free.
  - `math.ts` — pure helpers: len, dist, clamp, shade, distToSegment.
  - `types.ts` — Vec, Team, Role, PlayerEntity, HudState, StateListener.
  - `projection.ts` — the TV broadcast camera: holds module state viewCamX/Y,
    exports `proj()`, `setCamera(camX,camY)`, S_FAR/ZOOM/PITCH_TOP and the
    CAM_MIN/MAX/CAM_Y_MIN/MAX clamps. setCamera is how the engine syncs the cam.
  - `render.ts` — PURE renderer (~810 lines, was the biggest domain). Exports
    `renderScene(ctx, scene)` + `Scene`/`BallView` types. The engine builds a
    `Scene` snapshot each frame (camX/camY, ball, players[] as {p,kit} away-first,
    controlled, switchHint) and hands it over; `renderScene` calls `setCamera`
    then draws sky/crowd/pitch/goals/depth-sorted sprites+ball. NO game state
    lives here — all former `this.X` draw methods are private free functions.
  engine.ts RE-EXPORTS `CANVAS_W`, `CANVAS_H`, `HudState`, `TeamData` so
  HomePage.tsx still imports them from `@/client/game/engine` unchanged.
  Domains 6-10 (input, player-actions, off-ball AI, possession/physics, match
  rules) were NOT extracted — they read/write shared private class state and
  would need a GameContext refactor (higher risk); left in engine.ts for now.
- `src/client/game/engine.ts` — `PitchKickGame` class: the whole game loop,
  physics, input handling (window keydown/keyup), PC AI, and canvas rendering.
  REAL-SCALE PITCH: everything derives from `PX_PER_M = FIELD_W/105` (a
  regulation pitch is 105m × 68m). FIELD_W=2200 (105m, anchor), FIELD_H=
  Math.round(68*PX_PER_M)≈1425 (true 105:68 aspect — was 950, too narrow).
  Helper `M(metres)` → field px. NOTE: formations & proj() are all FRACTIONS
  of FIELD_W/FIELD_H, so the camera framing + players' on-screen positions/
  scales are UNCHANGED by the FIELD_H grow; only relative marking/player/ball
  sizes became correct. Caveat: speeds are still px/s, so vertical (depth)
  coverage now reads ~⅓ slower on screen than before — retune speeds if
  defending feels sluggish. 56px margin (`CANVAS_W=1400`/`CANVAS_H=700`
  exported — a wide 2:1 broadcast frame; was 1162. Widened so the goalmouth +
  net behind it stay fully on screen (a shot into the net used to clip off the
  right edge) and the pitch fills a wide monitor. render.ts uses CANVAS_W for
  all centring/fills so it adapts automatically; proj centres on CANVAS_W/2).
  The camera only shows part of the pitch (FIFA tele cam style):
  engine `camX` follows ball + vel*0.25 lookahead with exponential smoothing
  (k = 1-exp(-2.6dt)), clamped to CAM_MIN=360..CAM_MAX=FIELD_W-360. Render
  syncs module-level `viewCamX` from it; `proj()` offsets x by viewCamX.
  CLOSER ZOOM: S_FAR=0.66, S_NEAR=1.24, PITCH_TOP=110, PITCH_DRAW_H=560.
  BROADCAST ZOOM/CROP (user: "camera too far, don't show full field"):
  global `ZOOM=1.5` multiplies scale `s` AND the vertical offset, so the
  field is enlarged and CROPPED (touchlines run off top/bottom) like a TV
  tele cam. proj y = VIEW_ANCHOR_Y(400) + (baseDepthY(y)-baseDepthY(viewCamY))
  *ZOOM, where baseDepthY is the pre-zoom integral foreshortening. Camera now
  ALSO follows depth: engine `camY` follows ball.y + vy*0.18 (gentler,
  k=1-exp(-1.8dt)) clamped CAM_Y_MIN=0.30·FIELD_H..CAM_Y_MAX=0.82·FIELD_H;
  render syncs `viewCamY`. CAM_MIN/MAX pulled to 360 so the goalmouth stays
  framed at the tighter horizontal view. The ball sits ≈VIEW_ANCHOR_Y on
  screen. To zoom more/less change ZOOM (and re-check goal framing/anchor).
  Crowd+hoarding now anchor to the DYNAMIC far-touchline screen y
  (`proj(0,0).y`) since the far line moves with the depth pan; parallax uses
  farScale=S_FAR*ZOOM.
  Players projected off-screen (±60px horizontally) are culled.
  Calls a `HudState` listener each frame to push score/time/possession to React.
- `src/client/pages/HomePage.tsx` — hosts the canvas, scoreboard HUD, intro
  menu, team-select overlay, GOAL flash, and the controls legend. A `phase` state
  drives everything: `'intro'` (mode menu, the DEFAULT/landing screen) →
  `'select'` (team picker, MATCH mode only) → `'playing'` (engine running). A
  `mode` state (`'match' | 'practice'`) picks which flow. NOTE: the intro Kick
  Off screen was previously removed then RE-ADDED (user wanted a second Practice
  option) — it now has two `ModeCard`s: "PLAY MATCH" (→ select → playing) and
  "PRACTICE" (→ playing directly, default teams). `introIdx` + a keydown effect
  (←/→ choose, Enter confirm) mirror the select-screen feel; cards are also
  clickable/hoverable. `startMode(m)` sets mode + routes. `handleRestart` (the
  header "Menu" button) returns to `'intro'`. `handleRematch` bumps `gameKey` to
  re-mount the canvas game (the boot effect keys off `phase`/`gameKey`). The
  engine is instantiated in a `useEffect` keyed on `phase`/`gameKey`; for practice
  it builds REDUCED `TeamData` (`home.players.slice(0,5)` kickoffFwd:4 + away
  `slice(0,1)` GK-only kickoffFwd:0) and passes `{ practice: true }` as the 5th
  constructor arg. The scoreboard is a compact FIFA pill (`absolute top-3 left-3`):
  `[home bar][abbr][home]–[away][abbr][away bar][clock]` (clock pill shows
  "PRACTICE" in practice mode), colours/abbrs from the selected teams. Header
  shows Rematch (replay) + Menu (back to intro) while playing.
- PRACTICE MODE (engine `practice` flag, set via the 5th constructor opts arg
  `{ practice?: boolean }`): free-form rehearsal pitch — a few home players + a
  lone away keeper, NO match structure. Engine guards (all gated on
  `this.practice`): `placePracticePlayers()` (called at end of `resetKickoff`)
  stages home outfielders across the middle/attacking third, keepers on their
  lines, ball on a central player; clock/full-time skipped (update loop line
  ~623); `snapshotOffside` early-returns (no offside); `updateAwayTeam` delegates
  to `updatePracticeAway` (GK-only: saves via the normal keeper systems, and when
  he gathers, `practiceKeeperClear` hoofs it back toward the home players instead
  of `keeperDistribute` which would find no teammates); `checkOutOfPlay` respawns
  via `practiceResetBall` instead of throw-ins/corners/goal kicks; `handleGoals`
  counts strikes into the right (keeper's) goal as `homeScore++` with a quick
  "GOAL!" + a 1s `freeze` then `practiceResetBall` — no celebration/kickoff. The
  away GK saving/diving logic (`updateKeeperReactions`, `keeperParry`) is UNCHANGED
  and works with a GK-only away side. Teammate off-ball positioning uses
  `practiceSupportPlan` (NOT `offBallPlan`): mates fan into their vertical lane
  and hold a short-pass distance around the CARRIER (capped at `FIELD_W - M(24)`,
  never the goal line) so there's always a passing option. `practiceResetBall`
  RE-STAGES everyone via `placePracticePlayers` (early bug: it only moved the ball,
  leaving players upfield → pitch looked empty/stuck after a goal). The top-left
  scoreboard pill is HIDDEN in practice (`mode !== 'practice'` in HomePage); a
  small volt "PRACTICE" badge sits there instead. PASS-BACK-TO-OWN-GK FIX: control
  follows your pass (passToTarget sets `controlled = target`), so passing to your
  own keeper made HIM the controlled player — and `updateHomeTeammates` SKIPS the
  controlled player, so the GK never auto-distributed, teammates ran back to
  support him at the goal line, and play stalled. Fix: `updateControlled` starts
  with a practice guard that immediately hands control off any home GK to the
  nearest outfielder, so the keeper is always auto-managed (holds then clears via
  homeKeeperDistribute) and never a user-controlled dead end. SECOND pass-back
  symptom (GK "teleported/disappeared into the box"): `constrainKeeperWithBall`
  snaps a ball-holding keeper back inside his 16.5m box every frame, so a GK who
  came upfield to collect the back-pass got yanked ~16m back the instant he gained
  possession. See the general HANDLING rule below — the box-clamp now only applies
  while the keeper is actually handling (in hands).
- FULL-SCREEN LAYOUT (added after "make the field take the full screen, thinner
  top bar, no left/right margins, wider field"): outer is `flex flex-col` (NOT
  items-center, no page padding). Header is SLIM (`px-4 py-2`, brand `text-2xl
  sm:text-3xl`, was text-5xl). The pitch wrapper is `relative mx-auto w-fit
  max-w-full border-y` (full-bleed, no max-w-5xl, no side margin); the canvas is
  `w-auto h-auto max-w-full` with inline `maxHeight: calc(100vh - 168px)` so it
  fills the width but stays on one screen without distortion (overlays anchor to
  the w-fit wrapper = canvas bounds). Controls legend is `w-full px-4` 9-up on md
  (`md:grid-cols-9`, compact py-1.5). Goal-cut on scoring was fixed by the wider
  CANVAS_W=1400, not the layout.
- TEAM-SELECT SCREEN (FIFA-style, `phase==='select'`): two `TeamCrest` panels,
  LEFT = you (home), RIGHT = CPU (away). One side is `activeSide` at a time
  (home first). A window keydown effect (only mounted during select): ArrowLeft/
  Right cycle the active side's team (wrapping; CPU skips the home pick so the
  two differ); Enter / S / D confirm — home confirm locks (✓) and hands control
  to the away side, away confirm sets `phase='playing'`. Selection held as
  `homeIdx`/`awayIdx` into `TEAMS`. Crest (`TeamCrest`) draws a `KitJersey` SVG
  shirt illustration from the team's `kit` colours (shirt/sleeve/outline) with the
  kickoff striker's real shirt number, on a dark gradient block faintly tinted by
  team.color; the full team name sits below in `text-lg sm:text-xl`. Volt ring +
  pulsing chevrons when active. `readableOn(hex)` picks a legible number colour.
- KEY BINDINGS + SETTINGS POPUP (added on user request "settings menu item that
  pauses the game and opens a popup to edit key mappings, persisted in
  localStorage, with a reset-to-defaults"): `src/client/game/keybindings.ts` is
  the single source of truth — `GameAction` union (moveUp/Down/Left/Right, sprint,
  shot, shortPass, longPass, throughPass, switchPlayer, contain), `DEFAULT_BINDINGS`
  (values MUST equal the literal codes used inside engine.ts: ArrowUp/Down/Left/
  Right, KeyE/D/S/A/W/Q/C), `loadBindings`/`saveBindings` (localStorage key
  `wc2026.keybindings`, merges over defaults so missing keys fall back),
  `assignKey` (rebinds + SWAPS with any action already holding that code so every
  action stays uniquely bound), `codeLabel` (KeyW→W, ArrowUp→↑, etc.),
  `controlsLegend(b)` (builds the bottom 9-up legend) and `BINDING_GROUPS`
  (Movement / Actions, for the modal). Engine: treats DEFAULT codes as CANONICAL —
  `setBindings(b)` builds a `keyRemap` Map(physical→canonical) and onKeyDown/onKeyUp
  translate `e.code` through it, so ALL existing `this.keys.has('KeyW')` logic is
  untouched. Engine also has `setPaused(b)` (loop keeps running but skips
  update/render/emit while paused; clears held keys/charge so nothing sticks) and a
  5th constructor opt `bindings`. HomePage: `bindings` state seeded from
  `loadBindings()`, passed to both engine constructions; a `Settings` (gear) button
  is ALWAYS in the header. openSettings → `game.setPaused(true)` + modal;
  closeSettings → unpause. `applyBindings(next)` = setState + saveBindings +
  `game.setBindings(next)` (live). `SettingsModal` rebinds via a capture-phase
  keydown listener (so it beats the engine), Esc cancels, Done/backdrop closes,
  Reset-to-defaults applies `{...DEFAULT_BINDINGS}` (disabled when already default).
  The bottom legend + tip text are now derived from live bindings via codeLabel.
  Intro/select keyboard-nav effects gate on `!settingsOpen`.
- AWAY (CHANGE) KITS (added on user request "populate real data away kits... when
  choosing the away team, set the kit colour to the away colour, not home for both"):
  `TeamData` now has an `awayKit: Kit` alongside `kit` (home). Every one of the 48
  nation files was populated with researched real change-strip colours (white-out,
  navy, black, etc.). Wiring: (1) engine `kitFor(p)` returns `t.awayKit` for the
  visiting side's outfielders (GK still uses `gkKit`, home still `kit`) so on-pitch
  the away team wears its change kit; (2) HomePage `TeamCrest` takes a `useAwayKit`
  prop — the CPU (right) crest passes `useAwayKit` so its `KitJersey` renders
  `team.awayKit`; the YOU (home) crest still shows `team.kit`. `color`/`textColor`
  (UI accents/scoreboard) intentionally stay the home identity colours.
- TEAM DATA (per-country, small files): `src/client/game/teams/` — one file per
  nation exporting a `TeamData` (name, abbr, formation string, color/textColor
  for UI, outfield `kit` + `awayKit` + `gkKit`, `kickoffFwd`, and 11 `players`
  {num,name,pos}; index 0 = GK). Each `Kit` has shirt/sleeve/outline + an optional
  `shorts` (real home-kit shorts colour, e.g. Germany black, Argentina/Uruguay
  black, England/Spain navy, Brazil/Colombia/Sweden blue, Portugal/Senegal/
  Australia green; falls back to `sleeve`); `shorts` drives both the team-select
  `KitJersey` SVG and the in-game player shorts. `types.ts` defines the model + `buildSquad()`
  (pairs a roster with a shared formation template); `formations.ts` holds
  position templates `F_433` / `F_4231` / `F_442` / `F_352` / `F_343` (fractions,
  attacking RIGHT). `index.ts` exports the `TEAMS` array (the selectable roster).
  The 48 official WC2026 qualified nations (verified against Wikipedia's qualified
  list June 2026) — one file each, grouped by confederation in `index.ts`:
  UEFA 16, CAF 10, AFC 9, CONMEBOL 6, CONCACAF 6, OFC 1. NOTE: Italy, Denmark,
  Ukraine, Poland, Serbia, Costa Rica, Jamaica, Nigeria, Cameroon did NOT qualify
  (do not re-add — their files were deleted).
  ROSTERS VERIFIED (June 2026): every team's 11-man XI was transcribed ONE BY ONE
  from the official Wikipedia "2026 FIFA World Cup squads" page (real shirt numbers
  + real current players, captains honoured, withdrawn/injured players excluded —
  e.g. Germany has NEUER back as #1, no retired players like Kroos). The fetch
  method: get section indices via the Wikipedia parse API
  (`action=parse&page=2026_FIFA_World_Cup_squads&prop=sections`), then fetch each
  team's wikitext by `&section=N`. Each XI is ordered GK→4DF→4MF→2FW to match the
  engine's index→role mapping (i=0 GK, i≤4 DF, i≤8 MF, else ST; kickoffFwd=9 =
  central striker). When two squad members share a surname, disambiguate with an
  initial (e.g. `N. AL-DAWSARI`/`S. AL-DAWSARI`, `J. RODRÍGUEZ`, `I. SARR`).
  Surnames UPPERCASE with diacritics preserved. DO NOT rewrite squads from memory —
  always re-fetch the source if updating.
  WC2026 SCHEDULE & DEFAULT MATCHUP (`src/client/game/teams/schedule.ts`):
  a predownloaded group-stage fixture list so the team picker DEFAULTS to the
  live/next real World Cup 2026 game. Exports: `GROUPS` (the REAL official FIFA
  Dec-2025 draw — 12 groups A-L × 4 of our 48 TeamData, sourced from Al Jazeera,
  e.g. A=Mexico/SouthAfrica/SouthKorea/Czechia, I=France/Senegal/Iraq/Norway),
  `MATCHES` (all 72 real group-stage fixtures as `{kickoffUTC:Date, home, away,
  group, venue}` with the published GMT(=UTC) kickoff times Jun 11-28 2026,
  sorted by time; venues use FIFA stadium names, host-city mapping approximate),
  and `findCurrentOrNextMatch(now=new Date()): Match|null` — returns the LIVE
  match (kickoff ≤ now < kickoff+110min) else the next upcoming else null.
  Only GROUP STAGE is stored (knockouts reference TBD group-position teams, not
  usable as concrete defaults). HomePage seeds `homeIdx`/`awayIdx` from it once
  (via `useRef`, so nav still works) and renders a `FixtureBanner` on the select
  screen (Live now / Next up badge + Group + venue + local kickoff time). Falls
  back to TEAMS[0]/[1] when no fixture is current/upcoming.
  The ENGINE is team-agnostic: `new PitchKickGame(canvas, listener, homeTeam,
  awayTeam)` builds the match from the two `TeamData` (away mirrored on x),
  stores `this.homeTeam`/`this.awayTeam`, and uses them for names/numbers/kits
  (`kitFor` method) + GOAL / full-time messages. To add a nation: create its
  file and append it to `TEAMS`.
- PLAYER RATINGS (FIFA-style, added June 2026 — user: "player skill scores like
  in fifa, each rated up to 99 … Pace/Shooting/Passing/Dribbling/Defending/
  Physicality … affect actual ability … strong team beats weak team with same
  effort"). Tilt strength chosen by user = "Noticeable — clear advantage to the
  better team".
  - DATA MODEL (`teams/types.ts`): `Ratings = {pac,sho,pas,dri,def,phy,ovr}`.
    A roster entry may carry an optional `r: RatingTuple` = `[PAC,SHO,PAS,DRI,
    DEF,PHY]` (6 numbers, EA-FC scale 1-99). `buildSquad` calls
    `makeRatings(roleForIndex(i), entry.r)` per player → fills the tuple (or a
    `ROLE_DEFAULT` per GK/DF/MF/ST if `r` omitted) and computes `ovr` as a
    role-weighted sum (`OVR_WEIGHTS`). `roleForIndex`: 0=GK,1-4=DF,5-8=MF,9-10=ST.
    Each `SquadPlayer` now has `ratings`; `PlayerEntity` (game `types.ts`) carries
    `ratings` too; `engine.makePlayer` copies `squad.ratings` onto the entity.
  - GAMEPLAY WIRING (`ratings.ts`, pure multiplier module): BASELINE=75 ("average
    international") → multiplier 1.0. `attrMul(rating,spread)=1+((rating-75)/100)*
    spread`. Helpers + where they hook into `engine.ts`:
    · `paceMul`(spread .6) + `paceAccelMul`(.3) — applied INSIDE `steer()` so
      EVERY movement path (human + all AI) inherits top speed + accel from PAC.
      Single chokepoint: nothing else touches movement speed.
    · `shotPowerMul`(.4) + `shotSpreadMul` (better SHO ⇒ tighter aim, clamp
      .45-1.7) — in `shootAssisted` (human) and `updateAwayCarrier` CPU shot.
    · `passPowerMul`(.18) + `passSpreadMul` (better PAS ⇒ tighter, clamp .4-1.8)
      — in `passAssisted` (ground/through/long) and CPU pass.
    · `dribbleKeepMul` (better DRI ⇒ less ball-speed penalty while carrying,
      clamp .62-.99) + `dribbleTurnMul`(.5, turn agility) — in `updateControlled`.
    · `tackleReachMul`(.45, DEF) — in `pokeTackle`, the SINGLE funnel for ALL
      tackle paths (standing tackle, contain auto-poke, home AI, away AI, jostle),
      so DEF affects every challenge.
    · `duelRate` (PHY difference of challenger vs carrier, clamp .45-1.8) — in
      `updateJostle` shoulder-to-shoulder battles.
    `ovr` is display/AI-strength only; the 6 face stats drive actual gameplay.
  - HAND-RATED TEAMS: ALL 48 teams now carry per-player `r:[PAC,SHO,PAS,DRI,DEF,
    PHY]` tuples (EA-FC-knowledge values, grounded in each player's real rating
    profile — not the `ROLE_DEFAULT` fallback anymore). First 16 (top contenders):
    argentina, brazil, france, spain, england, portugal, germany, netherlands,
    belgium, croatia, uruguay, colombia, morocco, senegal, switzerland, usa.
    Remaining 32 rated 2026-06 in 4 batches: Americas (mexico, ecuador, paraguay,
    panama, canada, haiti, curacao, capeverde); Europe (norway, sweden, austria,
    czechia, scotland, turkey, bosnia); Asia/Oceania (japan, southkorea, iran,
    iraq, jordan, qatar, saudiarabia, uzbekistan, australia, newzealand); Africa
    (algeria, egypt, tunisia, ghana, ivorycoast, drcongo, southafrica). NOTE:
    obscure/squad-player values are level-appropriate estimates by role, not exact
    FC 26 numbers. To re-rate: edit `r:[...]` on the roster entry. Verify none are
    missing with: `for f in teams/*.ts; do grep -c "r: \[" "$f"; done` (each XI=11).
- Player names: each `PlayerEntity` has a `name` (surname) and real `num`. Names
  are shown as FIFA broadcast lower-thirds in the BOTTOM CORNERS (NOT above the
  player): home active player bottom-left, CPU active player bottom-right
  (each tag's accent + number text colour come from the selected team) —
  `PlayerNameTag` in HomePage, fed by HUD fields `homePlayer`/`awayPlayer`.
  `homePlayer` = `this.controlled`; `awayPlayer` = `this.awayActive` (away
  carrier, else outfield CPU nearest ball, computed in `updateAwayActive`).
  Above the head: the human-controlled player wears a solid green chevron; the
  Q switch-hint wears a hollow chevron. The CPU (away active) player gets NO
  above-head marker.
- Shot/pass power gauge: rendered in React as a thin (h-1) fill line directly
  UNDER the home player's bottom-left `PlayerNameTag`, fed by HUD `charge`
  (0..1 or null) from `chargeLevel()`. Gradient green->yellow->red, width
  animates with charge, hidden when not charging. The old canvas bottom-center
  `drawPowerMeter` segmented bar was removed.
- Match clock: counts UP like a real soccer clock (0:00 -> 90:00), accelerated.
  Engine tracks real `elapsed` secs; `MATCH_REAL_SECS=180` real seconds maps to
  `MATCH_DISPLAY_SECS=5400` (90'). HUD field is `clock` (in-game secs);
  `fmtTime` renders MM:SS. Full time fires at `elapsed >= MATCH_REAL_SECS`.

### Controls (FIFA PC style)
- Arrows = move, E = sprint, D = shot, S = short pass, A = long pass,
  W = through pass (leads receiver ~110px toward goal), Q = switch player.
- Q+W = LOFTED through ball (FIFA chipped through pass): hold Q while charging
  W. Q acts as a MODIFIER, not a player-switch, when used during a kick —
  handleSwitchKey suppresses the switch if owner===controlled, a charge is in
  progress, or any KICK_KEY is held. chargeLofted is captured at charge start
  (this.keys.has('KeyQ')); fire point recomputes lofted = chargeLofted ||
  keys.has('KeyQ') and forwards it through doHomeKick(code,charge,lofted) into
  passAssisted opts.lofted. In passAssisted, `isThrough && lofted` uses the
  SAME lead-into-space aim as the grounded through ball but a ballistic arc
  (T=clamp(0.5+d/M(95)+charge*0.2,0.5,1.15), vz=0.5*GRAVITY*T, hspeed=(d/T)*1.08)
  — lower/faster than a long ball so it still threads behind a stepping defender.
- KICK CHARGING (FIFA-researched: passes/shots charge on PRESS, execute
  on RELEASE; hold duration = power): chargeKey/chargeTime fields,
  CHARGE_FULL=0.8s. Release reads t=0..1; receiver & aim resolved at
  RELEASE (late lock). Lost ball mid-charge cancels; kickoff resets.
  Shot power = 430 + 870*t (~3x spread so charge is clearly felt; was
  500+340 which felt flat). Pass power = frictionBase * (0.78 + 0.55*t),
  capped 1600 — tap arrives soft, full overruns.
  Gauge UI: FIFA-style FIXED power meter — `drawPowerMeter(ctx)` called
  last in render(), a 320x16 rounded bar centred at bottom of screen
  (y=CANVAS_H-34), green→yellow→red gradient with diagonal chevron ticks
  and a "POWER" label, only while chargeLevel()!=null. (Replaced the old
  tiny above-the-player gauge — FIFA shows power bottom-centre, not on the
  player.) justReleased array cleared each frame like justPressed.
- INPUT BUFFERING (FIFA first-time kicks): a shot/pass pressed WHILE the ball
  is still travelling to your player used to be DROPPED (charge only started
  `if (!chargeKey && owns)` and cancelled the instant `!owns`). Now: when the
  ball is loose from our own kick (`incoming = !owns && owner===null &&
  lastKicker.team==='home'`), a kick key starts a buffered charge with
  `bufferTimer=KICK_BUFFER` (0.5s). While in transit it keeps charging (or, if
  released early, sets `kickPending`); the moment possession is gained (owns
  becomes true) it fires via doHomeKick — a first-time shot/pass. Buffer is
  dropped if an opponent intercepts (owner.team==='away') or the window
  expires. The KeyD standing-tackle is SUPPRESSED while `incoming` so it
  buffers a shot instead of lunging at our own pass. bufferTimer/kickPending
  reset on kickoff.
- JUST-KICKED GRACE (`ballFree`, set 0.12s in afterKick): a struck ball used
  to be "canceled" the same frame — afterKick sets owner=null but updateBall
  runs AFTER resolvePossession, so the ball is still at the kicker's feet when
  resolvePossession hands it to the nearest player within CONTROL_DIST
  (~29px), excluding only the locked kicker. An opponent leaning on the
  kicker's back is in range → instantly "receives" the kick. Fix: while
  ballFree>0, resolvePossession keeps owner=null and returns, so the ball
  physically clears the body cluster (~100-150px) before anyone can claim it.
  A defender genuinely down the lane can still intercept once it expires.
  ballFree decremented in the timers block; reset on kickoff.
- Shot assist (`shootAssisted`): shot always goes toward the CPU goal.
  The VERTICAL arrow held at the moment of pressing D picks the ZONE of
  the frame (Up = top half, desired spot = top corner; Down = bottom
  half; none/horizontal-only = whole frame, desired = center; facing.y
  lean >0.45 fallback when no arrows held). Within the zone, 9 candidate
  y's are sampled and scored: min(clearance,50) + inputPreference*16,
  where clearance = nearest distance of ANY other player (both teams) to
  the ball->target segment minus their radius (distToSegment helper near
  top of engine.ts). Picks the clearest lane so shots steer around
  blockers — user demanded this after shots kept hitting opponents.
- Pass receiver selection (v2, FIFA-researched after W kept skipping the
  near runner): the HELD ARROW direction at the moment of the pass picks
  the receiver (`heldDir`, falls back to facing when no arrow held).
  Score = align*260, -400 if align<0.1 (behind aim = last resort);
  short/through subtract d*(0.3/0.22) so the FIRST man in the aimed cone
  wins; long ADDS clamp(d,0,900)*0.12 (far outlet). NO distance bands
  (old ~380 through band caused the skip). Through passes exclude the GK.
  No-target fallback knock also uses heldDir.
  Control follows YOUR pass to the receiver (user-initiated, FIFA-style).
- BALL GRAVITY / AUTO-RECEIVE ON RECEPTION (added after "receiver runs away and
  misses the pass"; v2 after "I keep a direction pressed and they run off and
  miss"; v3 after "the receiver STILL doesn't move to get the ball — it stops
  short somewhere else and they just move in the direction I'm pressing"):
  passAssisted sets `this.passReceiver = target` (right after the null-target
  check, so all branches share it — incl. lofted/long, since it's set before
  those early returns); cleared in resolvePossession (once possession resolves)
  and resetKickoff. In updateControlled's movement `else` block, while
  `incoming && p === this.passReceiver` (incoming = !owns && owner===null &&
  lastKicker.team===home — stays TRUE even after the ball stops short, so the
  receiver keeps going to it). 
  v3 REWRITE — the v1/v2 design asked "will the user's CURRENT held run happen to
  intercept the ball?" and only nudged when it'd miss. That OSCILLATES: the
  instant gravity nudged toward the ball the predicted run looked fine again →
  gravity dropped to 0 → revert to input → drift away → repeat, so the receiver
  parked SHORT and never collected it. Now we instead SOLVE for the meeting
  point and commit: march the ball forward (stepT 0.05, up to 2.5s, exponential
  friction grounded k=BALL_DECAY=1.5 / airborne k*0.12, `dispK=(1-e^{-k·stepT})
  /k` per step); the first ball position the receiver can run onto in time
  (`tReach = max(0, gap-CONTROL_DIST)/runSpeed <= t`, runSpeed = sprint?SPRINT:
  RUN) is the interception → meetX/Y. If never catchable in the window, meetX/Y
  = where the ball ENDS UP (last sim point) — so a pass that stops short is still
  chased down. Then: if dist-to-meet > CONTROL_DIST, steer mostly at it —
  `heading = dirToMeet*(1-inputW) + input*inputW`, inputW = hasInput?0.3:0 — so
  the user can only bias the APPROACH ANGLE (which side to take it on), never
  steer the receiver off a ball they'd otherwise miss; speed→RUN_SPEED (unless
  sprinting). Once the ball is within CONTROL_DIST (at feet), full control hands
  back to the user.
- GOALKEEPER REWORK (added after "keeper deflects onto shooter / too passive /
  no pickup / no control-switch / W rush"). 5 changes in engine.ts:
  (1) ACTIVE POSITIONING — `keeperTarget` replaced by `keeperPlan(p)` returning
  {pos,speed}. Base behaviour = angle play: come off the line by
  `comeOut=clamp(220-ballDX*0.26,14,150)` and shift BOTH axes toward the ball
  (`f=clamp(comeOut/gl,0,0.5)` lerp from goal-center toward ball), all clamped
  inside the box (x to ownGoalX±M(16) boxEdge, y to goalTop+14..goalBottom-14).
  Speed RUN_SPEED if >90px away else WALK_SPEED. Used via offBallPlan
  (`if (p.isGK) return this.keeperPlan(p)`).
  (2) SWEEPER/AGGRESSION RUSH — auto-rush when a loose ball (no owner) or an
  OPPONENT carrier is inside the box AND no own defender is within 64px of the
  ball; also manual rush when home GK + `gkRush>0`. "In the box" requires BOTH
  depth (ballDX<M(18)) AND centrality (|by-mid|<M(18)) — without the centrality
  gate the keeper charged sideways out of his net on FLANK attacks (ball near
  the goal line in X but far out wide), leaving the goal gaping. Flank balls now
  keep him home playing the angle/near post. Rush charges at SPRINT_SPEED toward
  the ball lead-point (ball + vel*lead). MANUAL W rush vs AUTO sweeper rush differ
  in leash: auto is clamped to the box (x≤M(16) out, y within goal mouth ±28) so
  he never strays to midfield; MANUAL W is an explicit "rush keeper out" so he
  chases the REAL ball up to M(40) out across the FULL pitch width (y 20..FIELD_H-20).
  Bug fixed: previously BOTH used the box clamp, so pressing W with a central
  upfield ball slid the keeper horizontally to the box edge and stopped instead
  of running AT the ball — now manual W aims at the actual ball. Handles 1v1.
  (3) PICK UP LOOSE/SLOW BALL — in resolvePossession the GK's gather reach is
  CONTROL_DIST + (ballSpeed<320 ? 34 : 18) vs CONTROL_DIST for outfielders, so a
  slow ball near his feet is claimed before an attacker can steal it.
  (4) CONTROL SWITCH TO GK — removed the old `!best.isGK` exclusion; when the
  home GK gains possession he becomes `this.controlled` (auto-switch like any
  outfielder). On any GK gain we set stealProtect=1.1 (secure catch, can't be
  immediately re-stolen) and clear gkRush.
  (5) GK HOLDS BALL IN HANDS — `dribble(owner)` GK branch: the ball SCOOPS up
  into the keeper's hands — lerped to a point just in front of his body (facing
  dir, owner.r+ball.r+3) and lifted to z=M(0.95) (below CONTROL_HEIGHT M(1.25)
  so he keeps possession). The z lerp (0.35/frame from the grass) reads as a
  quick gather/pickup animation; render draws the ball raised by z*scale so it
  sits at chest/hand height, not stuck at the feet. Velocity = owner's so it
  travels with him. Replaces the old "glued at feet, z=0" hold (which looked
  like the ball was stuck to his boots). On RELEASE, kickBallToward now zeroes
  ball.z for any non-lofted (flat/ground) kick so a thrown/rolled distribution
  doesn't float down from chest height.
  KEEPER BOXED WHILE HOLDING — new `constrainKeeperWithBall()` (called after
  separatePlayers): while `owner` is a GK, clamp him to his own penalty area
  (depth M(16.5) from goal line, width mid±M(20.16)) so he can't carry the ball
  in hand out of the box (real-football handball). Only applies while he owns
  the ball; a ball-less keeper can still rush out.
  W-WITHOUT-BALL: in updateControlled, `!owns && !incoming`: a TAP of W sets
  `gkRush=1.5`, and HOLDING W refreshes `gkRush` to ≥0.25 each frame (FIFA
  hold-to-rush) so the keeper stays out instead of back-pedalling mid-charge.
  gkRush decays each frame in update(), reset in resetKickoff, cleared on GK gain.
  YO-YO FIX v2 (after "GK rushes too early while I'm far, then goes back as I
  get closer"): the v1 attempt that committed the keeper EARLY (carrier within
  M(28) and approaching) backfired — he bolted off his line while the attacker
  was still way out, parked at the box edge (clamped), then back-pedalled toward
  goal tracking the ball as the attacker finally entered the box. Fix: the AUTO
  carrier rush now triggers ONLY once the carrier is genuinely CLOSE — within
  M(13) of own goal (≈ penalty spot) AND central (|carrier.y-mid|<M(20)). Until
  then the keeper just plays the angle (comeOut). Because the trigger is now
  inside the box, the rush target (the ball, clamped to box edge M(16) / lateral
  mid±M(14)) never makes him retreat — keeper and attacker converge as he comes
  out to smother, and his bigger gather reach wins it. `carrierClose =
  |carrier.x-ownGoalX|<M(13) && |carrier.y-mid|<M(20)`; loose-ball rush still
  needs ballInBoxX && ballCentral. Holding W still overrides for a manual charge.
  COVERING-DEFENDER GUARD (added after "should the keeper rush if defenders are
  between him and the ball?"): autoRush also requires `!defenderCovering` — no
  own outfielder is positioned GOAL-SIDE of the ball (|m.x-ownGoalX| < ballDX-8)
  AND within 70px of the keeper→ball segment (perp distance via projection t
  clamped 0..1). If a defender is covering the lane the situation's handled, so
  the keeper holds his line instead of charging out past his own man and
  vacating the goal. `defenderOnBall` (mate within 64px of ball) still applies
  too. MANUAL W ignores both guards — explicit player command.
  LESS-PERFECT POSITIONING + CATCH-vs-PARRY (added after "GK positioning is way
  too perfect — every shot goes at the keeper, and he deflects every shot
  straight back into the attacker instead of to a side; weak shots should be
  simply caught and held"): three changes. (a) Angle-play `ty` now tracks only
  ~72% of the ball's lateral angle (`mid + gy*f*0.72`) — he holds a touch more
  central and can't magnetically cover both corners, so a well-placed shot into
  the open corner can beat him. (b) Fast-ball gather reach trimmed from
  CONTROL_DIST+18 to +12 (slow-ball +34 unchanged) so he doesn't gobble every
  shot passing near him. (c) NEW `keeperParry(gk,ballSpeed)`: in resolvePossession,
  before `owner=best`, if the keeper would gain a fast OPPONENT shot
  (`best.isGK && best!==prev && (!prev||prev.team!==best.team) && ballSpeed>820`)
  he can't hold it — instead PARRIES: ball velocity set mostly lateral toward the
  NEARER touchline (`side = ball.y<mid?-1:1`, vy=side*speed*0.9) with an outward
  component away from goal (vx=outSign*speed*0.5), small pop-up (vz=M(1.8)),
  speed=clamp(ballSpeed*0.42,200,380); ball nudged off the keeper's body to that
  side, `owner=null`, `ballFree=0.45` so it spills WIDE as a loose rebound (a
  striker must run onto it) rather than sticking to his hands or rebounding
  straight back. Shots at/under the threshold are still CAUGHT cleanly and held.
  PARRY THRESHOLD LOWERED 820→600 (user "GK catches shots too easily, should only
  catch weaker ones"): with shot power=(400+560*charge), 600 px/s ≈ charge 0.36,
  so only weak/placed shots are caught cleanly — anything firmly struck is parried.
  AWAY-KEEPER HOLD BEFORE DISTRIBUTING (added after "I don't see anything that
  changed — the keeper still immediately kicks the ball forward, even on the
  weakest shot, and never catches"): the ROOT CAUSE the user was hitting — the
  user attacks the AWAY goal, so the AWAY keeper makes the saves. Its
  `updateAwayCarrier` GK branch booted the ball upfield the instant it owned the
  ball (only gated by `cpuDecision`, which is usually already 0 on a fresh
  catch), so every save looked like an immediate clearance and the catch/hold-in-
  hands was never visible (and the parry/catch tuning was invisible too). Fix:
  the away GK now runs the SAME hold as the home GK — `gkHoldTimer += dt;
  if (gkHoldTimer < 1.1) return;` before distributing, so he visibly gathers and
  HOLDS the caught ball in his hands (~1.1s, dribble() GK ball-in-hands anim)
  before clearing. `gkHoldTimer` (shared, only one keeper holds at a time) is now
  RESET to 0 in resolvePossession whenever a keeper FIRST gains the ball
  (`if (best.isGK && best!==prev) gkHoldTimer=0`) so a stale timer from a prior
  possession can't make him distribute instantly.
  HANDLING / BACK-PASS RULE (added after "GK takes the ball in hands and instantly
  kicks out — he shouldn't take it in hands if outside the box; and in ALL modes
  he shouldn't handle a pass straight from a teammate"): real laws — a keeper may
  only handle (a) INSIDE his own penalty area and (b) NOT off a deliberate kick by
  a team-mate. New `gkHandling` instance flag + helpers `keeperInOwnBox(gk)` and
  `keeperMayHandle(gk, fromKicker)` (fromKicker = `this.lastKicker`; back-pass =
  same-team non-GK kicker). On any keeper gaining possession (resolvePossession),
  `gkHandling = keeperMayHandle(best, lastKicker)`. When TRUE → existing catch
  behaviour (scoop into hands, 1.1 stealProtect, hold-then-distribute, box-clamp).
  When FALSE → he controls at his FEET: the `dribble()` GK scoop branch is gated
  `owner.isGK && this.gkHandling` (else falls through to the normal feet-dribble),
  `constrainKeeperWithBall` early-returns unless `gkHandling` (so he's NOT snapped
  back into the box — this is what fixed the practice back-pass teleport), and no
  hand-catch protection. `keeperParry` (a hand action) is likewise gated on
  `keeperInOwnBox(best)` AND not a back-pass. Applies in ALL modes, not just
  practice. He still auto-distributes via homeKeeperDistribute / practiceKeeperClear
  (a FOOT kick), just without the hands visual/box-lock.
  REACTION-BASED SAVE REACH (added after "whatever I shoot the keeper keeps
  deflecting it — how does he reach it so well? he shouldn't catch/deflect strong
  shots from close so easily"): the keeper "saves" by gaining possession when the
  ball is within `reach` of his body — but reach was a FLAT radius, so a fierce
  point-blank shot was gathered exactly as easily as a tame long-range one (no
  reaction-time limit → magnetic keeper). New `keeperReach(gk, ballSpeed)`
  replaces the old `CONTROL_DIST + (ballSpeed<320?34:12)`:
  - Slow/loose ball (<340 speed): `CONTROL_DIST + 34` (generous hands-at-feet
    gather, unchanged) so he still claims loose balls.
  - A SHOT (>=340): reach = `gk.r + ball.r + buffer` where the buffer models how
    much time he had to REACT — `distBuf = clamp((shotDist-120)*0.05, 0, 26)`
    (grows with how far away the shot was struck, `shotDist = dist(lastKicker,
    gk)`) MINUS `pacePenalty = clamp((ballSpeed-520)*0.04, 0, 34)` (harder shots
    give less time; STRENGTHENED from (ballSpeed-680)*0.02 cap 16 so the hardest
    well-placed shots beat him outright), floored at 0. So a point-blank blast → buffer≈0 (he only
    saves what's hit straight at his body, ball can fly past into the corner);
    a 20-yarder → a real dive range across goal; a tame shot from distance →
    comfortably reached. This is the main lever that stops the keeper reaching
    every shot regardless of pace/range. Combine with the ~72% lateral tracking
    (positioning) and the catch(<=600)/parry(>600) split: weak shots within reach
    are caught & held, fierce shots within reach are parried wide, and shots he
    can't react to beat him cleanly.
  KEEPER DIVE REACTION + WIDER SHOT SPREAD (added after "the GK doesn't react on
  shots — I want him to dive or else; and shots are way too precise, no shots go
  wide, stronger shots should have even more chance to miss — like FIFA"):
  - DIVE ANIMATION: new PlayerEntity fields `diveTimer` (>0 while in the lay-out
    save pose, set 0.6s), `diveDir` (world-y sign of the dive), `diveCooldown`
    (0.9s lockout so he can't re-trigger every frame). Decremented in `update()`,
    reset in `resetKickoff`. `triggerKeeperDive(gk, dir)` sets the timers and adds
    a one-frame lunge impulse `gk.vy += dir*90` (survives ~1 frame before steer
    lerps it back). `updateKeeperReactions(dt)` runs in the sim loop AFTER team
    updates + resolvePossession: when the ball is loose, fast (>420), travelling
    toward a keeper's own goal, within M(20) of the goal line and within 95px of
    the keeper but >12px off-centre, he dives toward it — EVEN shots he won't
    reach (visible reaction, beaten cleanly). Dives also fire on off-centre
    catches (resolvePossession) and parries (`keeperParry`).
    DIVE-ONLY-WHEN-NEEDED (added after "the GK shouldn't dive on every shot when
    the ball is close to him and he doesn't need to dive to reach"): all three
    dive triggers now require the ball to be genuinely beyond standing reach —
    lateral offset `Math.abs(off) > M(1.7)` (≈36px) instead of the old 12/14px.
    A ball within ~1.7m of the keeper is gathered/parried STANDING (no dive); only
    a ball wider than that makes him throw himself across. (updateKeeperReactions
    uses live `ball.y - gk.y`; resolvePossession catch branch same; keeperParry
    captures `incomingOff` BEFORE it repositions the ball, dives toward it.)
  - DIVE RENDER (drawHumanoid): `diveLayout` (eased 0..1 body commitment) and
    `diveAirborne` (sin arc) drive a body translate+rotate, an upward lift, a
    fading/offset shadow, and overhead reaching arms (reuses the `celebrating`
    arm pose while diving & not kicking).
    DIVE-DIRECTION FIX (added after "the dive sometimes goes diagonally BACK —
    keepers should dive PERPENDICULAR to the shot, not reach back for an already
    missed ball"): the keeper dives along the GOAL MOUTH = world-y, which is
    perpendicular to the shot (world-x). But `proj` maps world-x→screen-x and
    world-y→screen-y, so the old render — which laid the body out along screen-x
    (`translate(diveDir*diveLayout*11,…)`, `rotate(diveDir*…*1.4)`) — was diving
    along the SHOT LINE (forward/back), and half the dives (diveDir=+1) threw him
    back toward his own goal. FIX: project the goal-mouth direction into screen
    space — `proj(p.x, p.y + diveDir*40)` minus `proj(p.x,p.y)`, normalized to
    `(diveSx,diveSy)` — and translate the body + shadow ALONG that vector
    (`translate(diveSx*diveLayout*13, diveSy*diveLayout*13 - diveAirborne*9)`),
    rotating/laying out by the horizontal component only (`rotate(diveSx*
    diveLayout*1.5)`) so a sideways dive lays out fully while an up/down-the-mouth
    dive reads as a leap with a gentle lean. No more diving back along the shot.
  - WIDER SHOT SPREAD (shootAssisted): `shotSpread = 0.06 + charge*0.2` (was
    `0.05 + charge*0.045`). Spread is triangular angular noise in kickBallToward,
    so untapped shots are fairly accurate but full-power blasts genuinely sail
    wide — strong shots have much more chance to miss, FIFA-style.
  HELD-BALL HUG + OUTFIELD SHOT BLOCK (added after "the GK holds the ball too far
  from his body; and strong shots at defenders get tackled into their possession
  instead of rebounding — strong shots can't be instantly tackled"):
  - HELD-BALL HUG: in `dribble()` the GK-in-hands forward offset was
    `owner.r + ball.r + 3` (≈16px out front, looked detached). Now `owner.r*0.25`
    (≈3px) so the ball reads as cradled against the chest. Still lifted to
    handZ=M(0.95).
  - OUTFIELD SHOT BLOCK (`outfieldBlock`): in resolvePossession, BEFORE
    `owner = best`, a field player (non-GK) who FIRST reaches a fast ball
    (ballSpeed > 600) as an OPPONENT of the kicker (or a loose fast ball) no
    longer cleanly traps/"tackles" it — it RICOCHETS off him as a loose rebound:
    deflected roughly back off the body (`atan2(-vy,-vx)`) + random ±1.3rad
    scatter, speed = `clamp(ballSpeed*0.4,140,420)`, small vz pop, nudged off his
    body, `owner=null`, `ballFree=0.3`. Slower balls (<600 — settled passes,
    decayed shots, in-lane interceptions which arrive ~240-550) are still cleanly
    received/intercepted. Parallels keeperParry (>820) but for field players.
- PASS-LANE OPENNESS (added after "passes go straight into the opponent"):
  receiver selection now also scores how OPEN the passing lane is, not just
  alignment+distance. For ground passes (short/through, NOT lofted long) each
  mate's lane endpoint (`passLaneEnd`: short = receiver +vel*0.2, through =
  led into their run, mirrors passAssisted's aim) is tested vs every outfield
  opponent via distToSegment - o.r. If clearance < LANE_OK(26px) the mate is
  penalized (LANE_OK-clearance)*7 — a defender in the lane (clearance≈0) ≈
  -180, strong enough to flip to an open teammate in the same direction but
  not an absolute veto. Opponents within 34px of the kicker are IGNORED (the
  back-presser sits at the start of every lane; handled by ballFree grace).
  Long passes skip the lane test (they fly over). This is the FIFA-assist
  behaviour: avoid threading the ball into a defender's feet.
- Switch selection (`switchScore`, lower = better): when CPU has the ball,
  candidates are scored by distance to an INTERCEPT point ~70px ahead of
  the carrier (direction = 50/50 blend of "toward home goal at x=0" and
  carrier velocity), with -55 bonus for goal-side players (p.x < carrier.x-5)
  and +60 penalty for players behind the play (p.x > carrier.x+15).
  Loose ball / own possession: distance to ball position + vel*0.35.
  User demanded this after Q kept picking players above/below the carrier
  instead of the goal-side defender. Hint shows when candidate score +25
  beats controlled's score.
- NO other automatic switching (user explicitly requested this). A hollow ▽
  marker (`switchHint`) shows who Q would select: home ball-owner if not
  controlled, else nearest home player to ball when meaningfully (30px)
  closer than the controlled one. Solid volt ▼ = controlled player.
- When a home outfield player gains possession (interception, loose ball,
  received pass), control AUTO-SNAPS to them in `resolvePossession`
  (FIFA-style: you always control the man on the ball). The GK is the
  exception — he auto-distributes. Off-ball switching is still Q-only.
  The old "stand and shield until Q" branch remains only as a fallback
  (reachable if the user Qs away from the carrier).

### Visuals: TV broadcast pseudo-3D camera (v3, user-requested)
- User never wanted pure top-down — wanted FIFA/TV angle. Simulation stays
  flat 2D (x = goal-to-goal, y = depth between touchlines); ONLY rendering
  changed. Projection in engine.ts top: `proj(x,y)` → screen {x,y,s} with
  scale lerp S_FAR=0.56 (far touchline, y=0) → S_NEAR=1.0 (near, y=FIELD_H);
  screenY uses the INTEGRAL of scale so vertical foreshortening is correct.
  PITCH_TOP=116, PITCH_DRAW_H=510, CANVAS_H=700 (CANVAS_W was unchanged AT THE
  TIME; later widened to 1400 — see the CANVAS_W note near the top).
- `drawHumanoid()` draws UPRIGHT footballers at foot position, scaled by
  depth: two-tone legs (skin + sock + boot w/ kit-accent flash) scissor with
  distance-driven `animPhase`, lift on swing, kick pose extends striking leg,
  arms counter-swing (far arm behind torso, near in front). GRAPHICS PASS:
  running LEAN (ctx.rotate(vx/SPRINT*0.13) when moving), torso vertical
  GRADIENT via shade() helper, collar arc, side seam, shirt NUMBER (per
  SHIRT_NUMBERS[i], drawn only when toward<0.1 = seeing the back), neck
  segment, radial head-shading gradient, gradient shorts. Head shows
  back-of-head hair when facing away (facing.y<-0.3), mirror by facing.x
  sign. Body height 44 at scale 1. HEAD radius `HR=2.9` (REAL proportion:
  ≈7.5 heads tall → ~0.24m head ≈ ball size; was 4.4 cartoon big-head which
  made the true-scale ball look wrong — user noticed). Hair/sideburn/neck
  all scale off HR. Markers ▼/▽ at q.y - 50*gs.
  `shade(hex,f)` global helper lightens/darkens #rrggbb by a factor.
- BODY ANATOMY ANCHORS (true ~7.5-heads proportion, audited): hipY=-H*0.47
  (raised from 0.42 so legs aren't stubby), shoulderY=-H*0.82 (was 0.78),
  headY=-H*0.92 (was 0.9). Torso narrowed to ±5.5 shoulders / ±4.4 hem (was
  6.5/5.2) ≈0.46m shoulders; side seam ±2.9→2.4 (was 3.4/2.8). Shorts
  roundRect(-5,...,10,8) (was -6,12). Arms lineWidth 2.5 ≈0.10m (was 3),
  anchors dir*4.8/6/4.4, hand r1.4 (was 5.5/7/5, r1.6). Limbs were ~15-20%
  too broad before this pass.
- LEG/BOOT THICKNESS audited to true scale (1 local unit ≈0.042m): thigh
  lineWidth 3.3 (~0.14m), shin 2.8 (~0.11m calf), sock tapers 2.5→1.9 toward
  the ankle (~0.07m), knee dot 1.5, boot ellipse 3.5×1.4 + accent 1.3×0.5.
  NOTE: ball PHYSICS radius BALL_R is true-scale, but the DRAWN ball is
  oversized by BALL_VIS_SCALE=1.3 (≈5.7×s px diameter) — football games draw
  the ball bigger than life so it's trackable. True-scale (4.38×s) read as
  "too small" to the user across several rounds; collision still uses BALL_R.
  Thigh ≈2.9×s px. When a user says "ball smaller than legs" prefer THINNER
  LEGS, but the visual ball is now deliberately ~head-sized for playability.
- LEGS are TWO-BONE IK (`drawLeg(footX,footY,lift,hipX,far)`): SEG=10.8
  thigh≈shin, knee solved at half hip→foot distance + perpendicular rigid
  offset (hgt=sqrt(SEG²-a²)) bent FORWARD (perp x-sign matched to facing),
  reach-clamped. Draws thigh (hip→knee skin), shin (knee→calf skin,
  calf→foot sock), knee highlight dot, angled boot w/ kit accent. `far`
  leg shaded darker. Called far first (drawLeg(...,-side*2.2,true)) then
  near (drawLeg(...,side*2.2,false)).
- Pitch: `projPath()` helper projects polygons. GRAPHICS PASS: 20 mow
  stripes each with its own vertical depth gradient, gradient apron,
  projected lines/boxes, centre circle + spot, penalty SPOTS + "D" arcs
  (via `strokeArc()`), corner arcs, and a radial VIGNETTE overlay.
  `strokeArc(cx,cy,r,a0,a1)` samples a field-space arc through proj;
  `spot(x,y)` draws a marking dot. GRASS TEXTURE: `drawGrassSpeckle()`
  (REPLACED the old horizontal mow lines per user request) — procedural
  blades on a 26px grid via deterministic per-cell sin-hash (stable, no
  flicker), short leaning tufts lighter/darker than turf, only visible
  cells visited, near tufts larger via proj scale.
- Goals are REAL standing frames: `goalGeom()` posts at (0|FIELD_W,
  goalTop/goalBottom), postH=M(2.44)*s, net + back structure drawn BEFORE
  players (`drawGoalBack`), posts+crossbar AFTER (`drawGoalFront`).
- FULL ENCLOSED NET (`drawGoalBack`): four wire panels via `netMesh(bf,bn,tf,
  tn,nu,nv,disp?)` (+`bilerp` of 4 screen corners) — back panel + roof +
  far-side + near-side, net sloping to 0.82 height at the back. HIT RIPPLE:
  engine `netRipple{left,right}` (0..1, decays ~0.6/s) passed in Scene;
  `startCelebration` bumps the scored side to 1; ALL FOUR panels displace via
  per-panel disp fns sharing `wobAt(phase)` cos shimmer: back = sin(πu)·sin(πv)
  bell out+down; roof = sin(πu)·v sag (pinned crossbar, deepest at back); sides
  = u·sin(πv) billow out+flutter (pinned post/rails, strongest at back). All
  pinned to the rigid frame, sign per `out` = side.
- GEOMETRY FIX (user: posts/boxes floated off the field line): the projection
  maps a CONSTANT-X field line (goal line, halfway, box depth-edge) to a BOWED
  curve, but they were drawn as straight 2-pt chords while posts sit at true
  proj positions → ~64px float. `projPathSmooth(pts,close,steps=12)`
  subdivides each segment so those lines follow the bow; used for the field
  outline, halfway line, and both boxes. Posts/boxes now sit ON the line.
- GOAL CELEBRATION (engine): scoring no longer instantly resets. `handleGoals`
  → `startCelebration(scoringTeam,msg,nextKickoff,side)`: settles the ball in
  the net (x = ±M(1.4) past the goal line), bumps `netRipple`, sets
  `celebration=4`s + `celebrateTeam`/`pendingKickoff`/`scorer` (=lastKicker if
  same team), flags non-GK players `celebrating=true`. `update()` runs
  `updateCelebration` (scorer wheels to the near corner, M(16) in; teammates
  mob behind) + `updateCamera` while frozen, then `resetKickoff(pendingKickoff)`
  when it expires. `drawHumanoid` raises BOTH arms above the head when
  `p.celebrating`. `PlayerEntity.celebrating?:boolean` in types.ts.
  CONCEDING SIDE NOT FROZEN (added after "opponent players freeze completely
  during celebration"): updateCelebration now loops ALL players, not just the
  scoring team. Non-celebrating players (the whole conceding team + the scoring
  keeper) walk back toward their formation `anchor` at WALK_SPEED*0.6 (slow,
  dejected) instead of standing still; the conceding keeper instead drifts
  toward the ball in the net (retrieving it). `concededTeam = (p.team==='home')
  !== scoredRight`.
- Stadium dressing: gradient sky, deterministic crowd dots, PITCHKICK
  hoarding strip above far touchline.
- Ball + players depth-sorted together into one draw list (ball is a
  drawable at depth ball.y); ball drawn with radial gradient, lifted 0.7r.
- Kits: HOME_KIT blue / AWAY_KIT red; HAIR_COLORS/SKIN_TONES vary per player.
- Researched open sprite options earlier: Kenney Sports Pack (CC0, static
  poses), LPC (4-dir 3/4 view) — procedural chosen deliberately.
- Uses ctx.roundRect (Chrome 99+/modern browsers OK).

### Movement feel (tuned for smoothness, v2 → realism pass v3)
- Inertia: `steer(p, tvx, tvy, dt, accel=ACCEL)` lerps velocity toward target
  via `k = 1 - exp(-accel*dt)`; facing rotates at max `TURN_RATE` rad/s
  (`faceToward`). AI `moveToward` decelerates within 36px of target to prevent
  orbiting. `steer` now takes an optional `accel` arg so the carrier can be
  given heavier inertia than off-ball players.
- REALISM PASS v3 (added after user: "too easy to run+score, passing too hard /
  everyone marked, defenders don't tackle, players too agile / no inertia,
  others don't sprint, overall too fast / ping-pong — bring close to real
  life"). All interdependent, tuned together:
  - INERTIA: `ACCEL` 8→5.5, `TURN_RATE` 13→10 (heavier, can't reverse
    direction instantly). New `DRIBBLE_ACCEL=4.6` — carrier turns/accelerates
    even heavier; passed as the `accel` arg in updateControlled's steer call
    when `owns`.
  - DRIBBLE PENALTY: `DRIBBLE_MULT` multiplies the carrier's speed in
    updateControlled (`if (owns) speed *= dribbleKeepMul(p.ratings, DRIBBLE_MULT)`)
    so you can't just sprint past everyone with the ball. See REAL-LIFE SPEED
    RE-ANCHOR below for the current value.
  - SPEEDS compressed + defenders made to sprint (v3): WALK 165→150, SPRINT
    255→228, AWAY_CHASE 180→220, RUN 200→205, PRESS 200→220, etc. — chasing
    defenders now keep up with a dribbler. SUPERSEDED by the real-life re-anchor:
  - REAL-LIFE SPEED RE-ANCHOR (added after user asked "is our speed with/without
    ball matching real life?"). Converting via PX_PER_M=20.95, the v3 free sprint
    of 228 px/s was 39 km/h (too fast — real pro max is 32-34, elite 36-38) and a
    PAC-97 player hit 44 km/h (impossible). The with-ball sprint (189 px/s ≈ 32.5
    km/h) was actually realistic — it just FELT slow because everything else blew
    past. Fix: anchored every locomotion constant to real km/h. New values:
    SPRINT 228→198 (34 km/h baseline), WALK 150→128 (22), TEAMMATE 150→128,
    AWAY_CHASE 220→191, AWAY_CARRY 192→176, AWAY_FORMATION 138→120, RUN 205→178,
    PRESS 220→191, JOCKEY 172→150, TACKLE_LUNGE 300→260, DRIBBLE_MULT 0.83→0.90
    (real high-speed dribble keeps ~90% of sprint ≈ 30.6 km/h). Also lowered the
    `paceMul` spread in ratings.ts 0.6→0.5 so PAC 99 tops at ~38 km/h (Mbappé
    record) and PAC 40 ~28 km/h, instead of 44. All relative balance preserved
    (defender chase still ≈ sprint so footraces stay fair); the whole game is
    ~13% slower in absolute terms but the dribble no longer feels left behind.
  - MARKING loosened so passing has outlets: `computeMarking` caps markers at
    `maxMarks = max(1, threats.length - 2)` (always ≥2 attackers left free),
    engage range 320→250, `markTarget` standoff 40→52, and the off-ball
    "get-open" bubble in offBallPlan 95→130 (teammates peel further off
    markers to show for a pass).
  - ACTIVE TACKLING (defenders now win the ball, not just stand there): shared
    `cpuTackleCd` field (0.55s, decremented in update()). updateAwayTeam: when
    a human carrier exists, the chaser aims directly at the man (x-6) and after
    the loop the nearest away outfielder runs `pokeTackle(p, CONTROL_DIST+10)`.
    updateHomeTeammates mirrors this against an away carrier for AI teammates
    (skips `controlled`). Both gated by `cpuTackleCd` so it's not a constant
    every-frame strip.

### Gameplay model (current: 11v11)
- Both teams: 11 players from the selected `TeamData.players` (index 0 = GK,
  1-4 DF, 5-8 MF, 9-10 ST by index → `role`). Away is x-mirrored. Each team's
  `kickoffFwd` (a striker) is the kickoff/initially-controlled player.
- Home attacks right; ball owner gets a lime ring.
- Non-controlled teammates hold formation, shifted by ball position
  (`formationTarget`: anchor + ball offset * 0.35x/0.25y).
- GOALKEEPERS (basic, `isGK` flag on index 0; distinct kits via `kitFor`:
  home amber HOME_GK_KIT, away mint AWAY_GK_KIT):
  - `keeperTarget`: tracks ball depth along the line (mid + (ball.y-mid)*0.55,
    clamped inside the frame), steps out 46px when ball within 320 of own
    goal, else 26. Never chases.
  - Home GK with the ball: `homeKeeperDistribute(dt)` — holds 0.7s
    (gkHoldTimer), then auto-passes to the most open non-GK teammate
    (openness = nearestOpponentDist - |x - FIELD_W*0.45|*0.1), power
    clamp(d*1.4, 480, 740). NOT user-controlled distribution.
  - Away GK with the ball: stands, then clears long to most open teammate.
  - GKs excluded from Q-switching (unless owner or ball within 160) and
    from CPU chaser selection (unless ball within 200).
- CPU AI: carrier dribbles toward left goal, shoots when x < 300, passes to a
  more-advanced open teammate when pressured (<85px); nearest non-carrier
  chases ball with anticipation; rest use offBallPlan. Decisions every 0.45s.
- OFF-BALL INTELLIGENCE (`offBallPlan`, both teams, user-requested "players
  should attack/defend/get open like FIFA"; applies to everyone except the
  controlled player, the carrier, the away chaser and the home presser):
  - v2 SHAPE MODEL (after user said v1 was too static + defence collapsed
    to the goal line): BALL-RELATIVE line depths, not anchor shifts.
    Players have `role` ('GK'|'DF'|'MF'|'ST' from formation index; also
    `isGK`). Depth = distance from OWN goal along attack dir. Per phase:
    - defend: DF clamp(ballD-200, 170, W*.52) — floor ≈ box edge, never
      goal line; MF clamp(ballD-20, 340, W*.68); ST clamp(ballD+230,
      W*.4, W*.75) stay up as outlet.
    - attack: DF clamp(ballD-420, 280, W*.58); MF clamp(ballD-150, 450,
      W*.8); ST clamp(ballD+170, 720, W-170).
    - loose: DF -300/220/.55, MF -80/400/.74, ST +200/640/.85.
    Plus formation stagger (anchorDepthFrac - roleCenter[.15/.33/.52])
    * W*1.6; y = anchor.y + ballShift * (defend .4 : .28). `formationTarget`
    was REMOVED (only keeperTarget remains). Catch-up: callers boost to
    RUN_SPEED when >240px from target spot.
  - ATTACK extras — ROLE-BASED SUPPORT (v2, after user: "as soon as I have
    the ball everyone runs to the opponent's goal / all do the same thing /
    nobody opens up or comes back"). Old v1 made EVERY non-DF level/ahead of
    the carrier within 560px run to the SAME spot (carrier.x+260) → whole
    team funneled at goal. FIFA model (confirmed via EA FC26 Pitch Notes:
    "always have someone available as a passing option", a MIX of run types)
    is now implemented as a team-level assignment `computeAttackSupport()`
    (recomputed every 0.35s with computeMarking; fills `attackRole` Map for
    the team in possession; roles: 'run'|'short'|'width'|'hold'):
    - run: up-to-2 most-advanced non-DFs that are level/ahead of the carrier
      → penetrate to carrier.x + dir*300, staggered into their lane
      (y = mid + laneSide*FIELD_H*0.22 + ballShift*0.2), RUN_SPEED.
    - width: remaining non-DFs whose anchor lane is wide (|anchor.y-mid| >
      FIELD_H*0.2) → hold touchline (y = mid + laneSide*FIELD_H*0.4) a touch
      ahead of the ball (fromDepth(ballD+90)).
    - short: up-to-2 nearest remaining mates behind/level with the carrier →
      check BACK to carrier.x - dir*150, offset laneSide*150 (safe outlet).
    - hold: everyone else (DFs + deep mids) keep the zonal line `t` to
      recycle possession + screen the counter.
    laneSide = anchor.y < mid ? -1 : 1. Final spot still drifts away from
    any opponent within 95px. Net effect: a couple run in behind, a couple
    show short, wingers stretch wide, defenders stay home — varied options.
  - DEFEND extras — man-marking overrides the zonal spot:
    `computeMarking()` every 0.35s (markTimer, markAssign Map
    defender->threat, cleared on kickoff) greedily assigns threats
    (non-GK attackers within 62% of pitch from defended goal, sorted by
    danger) to nearest free defender within 320px; excluded: GKs,
    this.controlled. `markTarget` = 40px off the attacker, direction 75%
    toward own goal + 25% toward ball. Markers move at 190.
  - HOME PRESSER: nearest non-controlled non-GK home player presses the
    CPU carrier (or a loose ball last kicked by the CPU — never chases
    home-kicked balls so teammates don't steal your passes) at
    PRESS_SPEED=200. Without this the home team never defended.
- PASS PHYSICS (v2, fixed after user reported passes dying short): ball
  friction is exponential (BALL_DECAY=1.5/s) so a kick at power v rolls
  only v/1.5 px TOTAL — old distance-multiplier powers physically could
  not reach targets past ~360px. All passes now use friction-aware
  `passPower(d, arrival, max) = min(BALL_DECAY*d + arrival, max)` so the
  ball ARRIVES still rolling at `arrival` px/s: short (260, 880), through
  (240, 1050), long (320, 1500), GK distribute/clear (300, 1300), CPU
  pass (260, 880). Shots still fixed 660 (unchanged, deliberately).
- THROUGH BALL aim (v3): leads along the receiver's actual RUN direction
  (their velocity, when moving >50; else straight at the opponent goal);
  lead is SPEED-PROPORTIONAL clamp(sp*0.45, 45, 110) — v2's fixed 200px
  was unreachable (user report). Never leads backwards (forward component
  forced to 0.55 if run points back). Through arrival speed 240 (was 300,
  rolled away from the runner). Short/long passes still lead vel*0.2.
  (Receiver selection: see "Pass receiver selection (v2)" above.)
- Pitch markings are now REAL DIMENSIONS via `M()`: centre circle & "D" arc
  r=M(9.15), penalty box M(16.5)deep×M(40.32)wide, six-yard M(5.5)×M(18.32),
  penalty spot M(11) from goal, corner arc M(1), spot dots M(0.12).
  GOAL_HEIGHT=M(7.32)≈153 (mouth width), GOAL_DEPTH=M(2.0)≈42, goal posts
  M(2.44) tall. PLAYER_R=M(0.52)≈11, BALL_R=M(0.11)≈2.3 (TRUE real-life
  scale per user — 0.22m ball; deliberately tiny; height renderer grows it as
  it rises so airborne balls stay readable),
  CONTROL_DIST=PLAYER_R+BALL_R+16. Sprite: `PLAYER_SCALE=M(1.85)/44` applied
  in drawHumanoid (ground decos use `gs=s*PLAYER_SCALE`; body `ctx.scale(gs,
  gs)`; head markers at q.y-50*gs) → footballer stands ~1.85m.
- Possession: nearest player (either team) within CONTROL_DIST grabs ball;
  kicker is excluded for 0.45s after kicking (`lastKicker`/`kickerLock`) so
  passes aren't instantly re-grabbed; lock clears when anyone receives.
- BALL HEIGHT (z-axis), user-requested for FIFA feel. Ball now has z/vz on
  top of x,y. `GRAVITY=M(46)` (exaggerated vs real 9.8 for arcade arcs),
  `BOUNCE=0.58` restitution, `CONTROL_HEIGHT=M(1.25)` (ball above this sails
  over everyone — resolvePossession early-returns owner=null while high).
  updateBall integrates z + ground bounce; horizontal friction is ~12% of
  normal while AIRBORNE (lofted balls carry, grounded balls decay as before),
  and a bounce scrubs 14% of roll. dribble() forces z=vz=0; resetKickoff
  zeroes them. `kickBallToward(aim,power,kicker,loft=0,spread=0.03)` — loft is
  upward vz launch; `spread` = angular error envelope (radians). Every kick gets
  FIFA-like imperfection: aim deflected by `spread*kickNoise()` and power *
  (1+0.05*kickNoise()), where `kickNoise()` = `random()-random()` (triangular,
  peaked at 0 → most kicks near-perfect, rare big sprays). Short/ground passes
  use the tight default 0.03; LONG ball 0.045; SHOTS the widest, 0.05+charge*
  0.045 (a power blast is less accurate than a placed side-foot).
  SHOT/PASS POWER IS REAL-LIFE-ANCHORED (px/s ×0.172 = km/h, PX_PER_M=20.95),
  same approach as movement speeds. SHOT launch = (400+330*charge)*shotPowerMul:
  charge 0 (placed) = 400 px/s ≈ 69 km/h, charge 1 (avg striker) = 730 ≈ 125 km/h,
  elite (shotPowerMul ~1.10) ≈ 137 km/h — matches the hardest real strikes.
  REDUCED from the old (620+720*charge) which peaked at ~230 km/h (avg) / ~252
  (elite) — faster than any shot ever recorded — on user note "shots are too
  strong, make it closer to real life". CPU shot reduced 640→600 px/s (~103 km/h).
  PASS launch is FRICTION-COMPENSATED (passPower=1.5*d+arrival) to ARRIVE at the
  receiver at a fixed speed (short 260 px/s ≈45 km/h, through 240 ≈41 km/h) ×
  weight scale=0.84+0.38*charge (band TIGHTENED from 0.78+0.55*charge so a tap
  isn't limp and a full-charge drive doesn't rocket past the target); launch caps
  lowered short 880→780, through 1050→920 (≈134/158 km/h ground-pass ceiling).
  SHOTS:
  POWER = (400+560*charge)*shotPowerMul: tap ~400 px/s ≈69 km/h (gentle roll),
  full ~960 ≈165 km/h (screamer, slightly arcade). WIDE ~2.4× range (was a narrow
  1.8× / (400+330*charge) that felt the same + too weak per user "shots seem too
  weak, they all fly the same; weak shots should be purely on ground, strongest
  fly more"). LOFT is tied to power via apex-height: liftCharge=clamp((charge-
  0.25)/0.75,0,1), shotApex=min(liftCharge²*M(2.7),M(2.35)), loft=sqrt(2*GRAVITY*
  shotApex) (0 when apex 0). So charge<0.25 = PURELY GROUNDED roll (loft 0), and
  loft climbs steeply after, a full strike flying ~M(2.35) just under the bar,
  apex reached ~20m out so it's still RISING at the line. (Replaced the earlier
  shotApex=M(0.1)+charge²*M(2.3) which never fully grounded the weak shots.)
  CPU shot uses a fixed low apex M(0.7). This REPLACED the old fixed loft=M(4)+charge*M(9.5) (and the CPU's
  flat M(8)) on user note "the shot is always in the same arc — it's rare to see
  shots go up and down into goal; usually they're mostly on ground or going up
  and up. Is your physics right?". ROOT CAUSE: the integration was correct but
  GRAVITY was M(46) ≈4.7× real, forcing every lofted ball into a tight up-and-over
  parabola that peaked within ~10m, so any 15-20m shot was always DESCENDING into
  goal. FIX: GRAVITY M(46)→M(18) (~1.8× real) so a struck ball arcs over ~18-20m
  and a typical shot is still RISING (or low/flat) at the line. Lob passes/throw-
  ins/keeper distribution are T-parameterized (vz=0.5*GRAVITY*T, hspeed=d/T) so
  their landing spot & TIMING are unchanged by the gravity drop — only the visible
  arc flattens (more realistic). LONG PASS (A) = BALLISTIC LOFT: solves hang time T=clamp(0.62+
  d/M(70)+charge*0.25,0.6,1.5), vz=0.5*GRAVITY*T, hspeed=d/T*1.12 → flies
  over defenders, drops on receiver. Short/through stay grounded. handleGoals
  rejects balls with z>M(2.44) (over the bar). drawBall lifts sprite by
  z*q.s, shrinks/fades the ground shadow with height (hf=1/(1+z*0.03)), and
  grows the ball slightly as it rises. Ball depth-sorts at its GROUND y.
- AERIAL PASS LOCK (added after "the ball is intercepted during A or Q+W when
  it is up in the air"): a LOW-arc lofted pass dips below CONTROL_HEIGHT in
  mid-flight, so a defender in the lane could trap it out of the air. Fix:
  `aerialReceiver: PlayerEntity|null` records the intended receiver of a lofted
  pass. Set right AFTER kickBallToward in: passAssisted (long-ball A + lofted
  through Q+W), executeThrowIn (the throw target), and keeperDistribute (lofted
  clearance branch). afterKick clears it by default (a normal kick is not a
  protected aerial pass), so only those callers re-arm it. In resolvePossession,
  while `aerialReceiver` is set AND the ball is still airborne (`z>M(0.4) ||
  vz>5`), the interception loop SKIPS everyone except aerialReceiver — the pass
  can't be picked off mid-air, only the target gathers it as it drops. Cleared
  the instant the ball LANDS (z<=0 in updateBall → normal loose ball, whoever's
  at the drop contests it), and in resetKickoff/queueRestart.
- Tackling (fixed twice after user reports; v2 fixed the GEOMETRY, not just
  timers — the dribble used to push the ball ahead of the tackler's facing,
  i.e. straight back into the opponent):
  - On tackle win: winner's `facing` is flipped AWAY from the tackled
    opponent and the ball is placed on that far side.
  - While `stealProtect` > 0 the dribble glues the ball to the feet
    (ahead = r+ball.r-2, snap 0.55) instead of 4px out front (snap 0.3).
  - Hysteresis: current owner retains vs challengers unless challenger is
    7px closer to the ball AND `stealProtect` elapsed (same-team takeovers
    bypass the margin).
  - `stealProtect`: 0.9s after winning a tackle, 0.35s after a clean
    receive. `dispossessed` lockout: 1.2s (loser can't claim at all).
  - `separatePlayers()`: soft circle collision each frame (minD = sum of
    radii - 4) so opponents can't stand inside the carrier.
  - All timers reset on kickoff.
- DEFENDING CONTROLS (FIFA-style, added after user noted tackles felt
  passive-only):
  - `canTackle(tackler, carrier, requireBallSide=true)`: REALISM GATE.
    (a) BALL-side check (only when requireBallSide): sideDot =
    (ball-carrier)·(tackler-carrier) >= 0, so a defender shielded out behind
    the carrier can't make a CLEAN nick; (b) facing check (always): faceDot of
    (tackler.facing · dirToBall) > 0.15 (~within 80°). TACKLE-FIX v4 (user:
    "I can just run with the ball, opponent can't tackle even when I stop /
    stuck behind me"): the ball-side requirement is now OPTIONAL. `pokeTackle`
    (clean nick) keeps requireBallSide=true, but `updateJostle` (physical
    body-contact steal) calls `canTackle(q, o, false)` so a defender pressed
    against the carrier's back CAN strip it loose — you can no longer shield
    forever by running straight.
  - `pokeTackle(tackler, reach)`: shared steal primitive — if an opposing
    non-GK carrier exists, stealProtect elapsed, tackler not `dispossessed`,
    ball within reach, AND canTackle passes, the ball is placed 6px past the
    tackler on the far side from the carrier (resolvePossession then awards
    it via the normal tackle-won path: 0.9s protect, 1.2s dispossess lockout).
  - D with NO ball = standing tackle: `tackleTimer=0.22s` lunge at
    TACKLE_LUNGE_SPEED=310 toward ball+vel*0.1 (`tackleDir`), poking with
    reach CONTROL_DIST+18 each frame; `tackleCooldown=0.8s` commit (whiff =
    beaten). D WITH ball still charges a shot (charge starts only if owns).
  - A with NO ball = SLIDING TACKLE (FIFA-style high-risk/high-reward,
    added on user request "add a sliding tackle just like in Fifa"; A/circle is
    the long pass ON the ball, the slide OFF it — overload, trigger guarded by
    `!owns && !incoming`). Was on Space, moved to KeyA on user note "why is
    sliding tackle space??? it is supposed to be A" (Space removed from ACTION_/
    MOVE_KEYS). A fully committed, longer-range lunge along your CURRENT heading
    (falls back to ball+vel*0.12 if near-stationary). Per-player `slideTimer=0.7s`
    + `slideDir` (PlayerEntity, types.ts); engine `slideCooldown=1.5s`. KeyA is
    already in KICK_KEYS/ACTION_KEYS so justPressed captures it; the charge logic
    only starts on a kick key if (owns||incoming) so A off the ball won't charge a
    pass, it slides. Two phases in updateControlled (FIRST branch in
    the movement chain, gated by `sliding`): lunge while slideTimer>0.4s —
    steer along slideDir at SLIDE_LUNGE_SPEED=330 ×decaying-frac with
    ACCEL*1.6, `pokeTackle(p, CONTROL_DIST+30, false)` (longer reach, ball-side
    NOT required so you can slide in from any angle); recovery while
    slideTimer<=0.4s — steer to 0, NO input, NO tackle (grounded = beaten if
    mistimed). While `sliding`, the W (gkRush) and D (standing tackle) triggers
    are suppressed. Timers decremented in the global per-player loop +
    slideCooldown in the engine timer block; both reset in resetKickoff. RENDER
    (render.ts drawPlayer): FEET-FIRST grounded skid. `slideLayout` ramps flat
    fast over the first 45% then sits back up, with NO airborne lift. CRITICAL:
    the body is drawn feet-at-origin/head-up, so the slide must do the OPPOSITE
    of the keeper dive — push the figure FORWARD along the projected slideDir
    (planted feet lead) and recline the torso BACKWARD via a NEGATIVE rotation
    (`rotate(-slideSx*slideLayout*1.2)`) so the head trails low. Leg override
    (next to the kicking one): leading leg extended forward fx*11, trailing leg
    tucked fx*4, both planted (no swing/lift). FIXED on user note "the player
    dives head forward while anchored legs on the ground — opposite of a slide";
    the original reused the dive's POSITIVE rotation (head-first). Shadow
    stretches along slideDir.
  - C (hold) = contain: auto-jockeys to a spot 30px goal-side of the away
    carrier at JOCKEY_SPEED=180 (E sprint → SPRINT*0.94), auto-pokes at
    reach CONTROL_DIST+8 (0.5s cooldown). With loose ball, C hunts the ball.
    KeyC added to MOVE_KEYS (hold key, no justPressed).
  - Auto jostle (`updateJostle`, runs before resolvePossession, both teams):
    nearest opposing non-GK in body contact with the carrier (centre dist <
    r+r+3 — TIGHTENED in v4.2 from +11, see below) accumulates `jostle` += dt (decays 2.5x when no
    contact / protected); at 0.5s the challenger pokes the ball loose
    automatically. Challenger qualifies via `canTackle(q, o, false)` — any
    side, so a defender on the carrier's back wins it; the WIN call is
    `pokeTackle(challenger, Infinity, false)`. `jostle` reset on possession
    change, kickoff and successful pokes.
  - TACKLE-FIX v4.1 (user: "I can STILL run away without sprinting by keeping
    my back turned"): `pokeTackle` now takes a `requireBallSide=true` param it
    forwards to canTackle. The earlier v4 fix qualified the behind-challenger
    with requireBallSide=false but then the jostle's WIN still called
    `pokeTackle(challenger, Infinity)` with the DEFAULT true — so the steal was
    silently re-rejected by the ball-side gate and the carrier could shield
    forever. Now the jostle win passes false, so a back-turned shield actually
    loses the ball after ~0.5s of body contact. (The chaser already catches up:
    walking carry ≈ WALK 128 ×pace×dribble ≈115 px/s vs AWAY_CHASE 204.)
  - TACKLE-FIX v4.2 (user: "the defender is still FAR from my back when they
    win it"): the jostle contact threshold was r+r+11 ≈ 33px centre dist, which
    with PLAYER_R≈11 left ~11px (≈0.5m) of daylight when the steal fired.
    Tightened to r+r+3 (≈25px) so the timer only accrues once the defender is
    genuinely shoulder-to-shoulder. separatePlayers() floors centre dist at
    r+r-4 (≈18px) and `driveToward` keeps barging the chaser in, so the gap
    closes to touching well inside the 0.5s window — the ball now pops with the
    defender visibly on the carrier's back, not hanging off it.
  - TACKLE-FIX v4.3 POSITION-WEIGHTED DUEL (user: "tackling from behind is too
    easy now — they should get to my SIDE to actually win it, eventually if
    faster but not right away"): jostle accrual is no longer a flat rate. It's
    scaled by `posFactor` from the challenger's position vs the ball:
    `alignment = norm(ball-carrier)·norm(tackler-carrier)` (+1 ball-side/front,
    0 alongside, -1 dead behind — the ball sits ~17px in front of the carrier
    in their facing dir, so a chaser behind reads ≈-1). `posFactor = 0.22 +
    ((alignment+1)/2)*0.78` → dead behind ≈0.22 (×duelRate, so a pure back-
    shield needs ~2s of sustained tight contact to win — "eventually if he
    stays glued", not instantly), alongside ≈0.6 (~0.8s), ball-side 1.0
    (~0.5s). So a faster defender still wins from behind eventually, but the
    quick steal requires working around to the side/front. Combines with
    PHYSICALITY (duelRate).
  - TACKLE-FIX v4 CHASE-INTO-CONTACT: `moveToward` decelerates within 36px of
    its target, so chasers used to hover ~6px behind the carrier and never make
    body contact (no jostle, no steal). New `driveToward(p, t, speed, dt)` is a
    no-slow-in steer that barges straight into the man. The away chaser (vs a
    human carrier) and the home presser (vs an away carrier) now use
    `driveToward` at AWAY_CHASE_SPEED / PRESS_SPEED (both bumped 191→204 px/s
    ≈35 km/h, just over an average dribbler) so a free defender runs the
    carrier down and into a jostle. A genuine PAC 95+ speed-merchant can still
    occasionally pull away — realistic given the ratings.
  - TACKLE-FIX v4.4 SECOND-MAN CONTAINMENT (user: "I want defenders to be MORE
    AGGRESSIVE. When I run forward all the defenders in front just keep
    backpedalling toward their goal — no one pressures me or tries to CONTAIN me
    to force a pass, I just keep running"): the defensive AI previously had only
    ONE engager (away `chaser` / home `presser`) drive the ball; everyone else
    held zonal lines that retreat as the carrier advances, so the user could jog
    through unopposed. Modeled FIFA's first-defender(press)+second-defender
    (contain) pairing. Two new helpers:
    - `containTarget(d, carrier, gap=90)`: returns a clamped spot `gap`px GOAL-
      SIDE of the carrier on the carrier→defended-goal line (goal x=0 for home,
      FIELD_W for away). The jockey position the second defender holds.
    - `pickContainer(defenders, carrier, presser)`: picks the nearest outfielder
      — excluding the presser and the user's `controlled` — that is goal-side of
      the carrier (depthToGoal(p) <= carrierDepth+30), falling back to nearest
      remaining outfielder if none is goal-side. This is the "second man".
    Both `updateAwayTeam` and `updateHomeTeammates` compute a `container` when a
    user/away carrier exists and add a branch: the container `moveToward`s its
    `containTarget` at PRESS_SPEED. Uses `moveToward` (slow-in) NOT `driveToward`
    so the second man SETTLES into the contain line and jockeys rather than
    diving in — committing the tackle is still the presser's job. Net effect: as
    the user carries forward, the nearest covering defender steps UP to sit
    ~90px goal-side and shepherd him wide / force the pass, instead of the whole
    block just retreating.
  - FIFA reference: tackles are manual buttons; contain auto-pokes; physical
    seal-outs from running into the dribbler are automatic; C = contain on
    PC keyboard.
- OUT OF PLAY → THROW-IN / GOAL KICK / CORNER (added after "add proper ball
  going out of field — sides and goal kicks don't exist, it just bounces back"):
  the touchline/byline BOUNCE in updateBall was REMOVED and replaced with
  `this.checkOutOfPlay()`. A persistent `lastTouchTeam: Team|null` tracks who
  last touched the ball (set in afterKick, resolvePossession on a gain,
  keeperParry, outfieldBlock, awardRestart; reset in resetKickoff) — distinct
  from `lastKicker` which CLEARS on possession, so it survives a loose ball going
  out. `checkOutOfPlay()`:
  - TOUCHLINE (b.y<0 || b.y>FIELD_H) → THROW-IN to the team that did NOT touch it
    last, at the exit point (spotX clamped M(3)..FIELD_W-M(3)), taker is nearest
    outfielder. NO banner text (awardRestart called with empty label → setMessage
    skipped). Taken with the HANDS (see THROW-IN BY HAND below), not a kick.
  - BYLINE (b.x<0 || b.x>FIELD_W): if the ball is in the goal mouth (goalTop<y<
    goalBottom) AND under the bar (z<=M(2.44)) it RETURNS EARLY — that's a GOAL,
    handleGoals (runs after updateBall) scores it; do NOT misread it as out. Else:
    last touch by the ATTACKING team → GOAL KICK to defenders (spot M(5.5) out
    from goal, taker = GK); last touch by the DEFENDING team → CORNER to attackers
    (spot at the goal-line corner, M(1) from the near touchline), taker nearest
    outfielder. attackingTeam attacks that goal: left line (x<0) ← away attacks,
    right line ← home attacks.
  - `awardRestart(team, spotX, spotY, label, takerIsGK, isThrowIn=false)`: stops
    the ball dead at the spot, zeroes ALL players' momentum + kick/dive/throwing
    timers, picks nearest taker (GK pool if takerIsGK else outfield) and places
    them just behind the ball, sets owner=taker, controlled = home taker (else
    home kickoffFwd), pans camera, `setMessage(label,1.6)` ONLY if label is
    non-empty, `freeze=0.9`, sets `throwInTaker = isThrowIn ? taker : null` +
    `taker.throwing`, and clears all transient state (lastKicker, kickerLock,
    stealProtect=1.0, dispossessed, offside flags, marks, ballFree, jostle,
    tackle/charge timers, gkRush, passReceiver) plus lastTouchTeam=team. Modeled
    on the callOffside restart pattern.
  - THROW-IN BY HAND (added after "the throw should be with hands, not feet; and
    no text announcement"): a throw-in is NOT a foot kick. New field
    `throwInTaker: PlayerEntity|null` + `PlayerEntity.throwing?:boolean`.
    While `owner === throwInTaker`, `dribble()` holds the ball OVERHEAD in both
    hands (lerps ball to the taker's position, z→M(2.1)); resolvePossession's
    high-ball early-return (`z > CONTROL_HEIGHT`) is skipped for the throwInTaker
    so he keeps the overhead ball. `drawHumanoid` raises both arms (reuses the
    celebrating/dive arm-up pose) when `p.throwing`. RELEASE: `executeThrowIn(
    thrower, isHome)` — intercepted at the TOP of `doHomeKick` (user, any kick
    key → throw, isHome=true) and at the top of `updateAwayCarrier` (CPU, after a
    short cpuDecision beat, isHome=false). It picks a SHORT pickPassTarget, disarms
    throwInTaker/throwing BEFORE launching, then kickBallToward with a modest
    lofted arc (T=clamp(0.45+d/M(60),0.4,1.0), vz=0.5·GRAVITY·T, hspeed=min(d/T,
    900), spread 0.04) — a two-handed toss, much shorter range than a kick — and
    `offsideFlags.clear()` (no offside from a throw-in, real rule). throwInTaker is
    also cleared in resetKickoff and at the start of awardRestart.
  - OUT-OF-PLAY PAUSE (added after "it instantly changes to goal kick, I can't
    see what's happening — keep showing it 1-2s before switching"): checkOutOfPlay
    no longer calls awardRestart directly; it calls `queueRestart(team, spotX,
    spotY, label, takerIsGK, isThrowIn)` which only clears owner/aerialReceiver,
    stashes `pendingRestart`, and sets `outOfPlay = 1.2` — it does NOT freeze the
    ball. `update()` has an early branch: while `outOfPlay > 0` it decrements the
    timer, runs updateCamera, AND keeps coasting the ball via `integrateBall(dt,
    3.2)` (3.2× drag) clamped to ±M(7) past each edge — so the ball CARRIES ON
    past the line and rolls/flies out (FIFA-style) instead of stopping dead at the
    border, decelerating quickly into the netting/crowd and staying in view. When
    the timer hits 0 it pops pendingRestart and calls awardRestart (which snaps the
    ball to the restart spot and freezes 0.9s more with its banner). Total dead
    time ≈ 2.1s. `outOfPlay`/`pendingRestart` reset in resetKickoff. (Ball physics
    integration was factored out of updateBall into `integrateBall(dt, dragMul=1)`
    so the coast can reuse it with heavier drag.)
  - OPPONENT KEEP-DISTANCE (added after "opponents should keep some distance from
    the kicker/thrower, isn't there a minimum?"): `pushOpponentsFromSpot(keepTeam,
    spot, minDist)` shoves every NON-keeper player NOT on keepTeam radially out to
    minDist from the spot (clampToField after). awardRestart calls it with keepOut =
    throw-in M(4), goal kick M(11), other (corner) M(9.15); callOffside calls it
    with M(9.15) (regulation free-kick distance). Keepers and the taking team are
    exempt.
  - KEEPER LONG CLEARANCE (added after "GK keeps passing to very close after goal
    kick / catch instead of kicking farther, creating risky situations"): shared
    `keeperDistribute(gk)` replaces both keepers' inline target pick. Scores each
    outfield mate by `forward*0.6 + min(open,220)` with heavy penalties for being
    close (d<M(20): -1500) or marked (open<M(6): -700), so it favours an open mate
    well UPFIELD. If chosen mate is >M(22) away it launches a lofted ballistic arc
    (T=clamp(0.6+d/M(70),0.6,1.5), hspeed=min(d/T*1.12,1600)), else a grounded
    pass. homeKeeperDistribute (0.7s hold) and the away-GK branch in
    updateAwayCarrier (1.1s hold + cpuDecision gate) both delegate to it.
- BOTTOM TOUCHLINE VISIBILITY: `CAM_Y_MAX = FIELD_H * 0.82` (was 0.70). At 0.70
  the near (bottom) touchline projected ~706px, just off the 700px canvas even at
  max depth pan, so it was never visible; 0.82 brings it on-screen (~589-609px)
  during bottom-third play. CAM_Y_MIN stays 0.30.
- 2-minute timer; goals reset to kickoff (conceding team kicks off);
  full-time verdict freezes play.
- OFFSIDE (both teams): `snapshotOffside(kicker)` runs inside `afterKick` (the
  single kick choke point), recording into `offsideFlags` (Set<PlayerEntity>)
  every teammate who, AT THE INSTANT OF THE PASS, is (a) in the opponent half,
  (b) ahead of the ball, AND (c) ahead of the 2nd-last defender (offside line).
  Positions are projected onto the attack axis via `fwd(x)=x*atk` (atk=+1 home /
  -1 away) so "more forward" is always larger; offside line = 2nd-largest
  `fwd(opp.x)` (keeper is usually deepest/last). 6px tolerance so level=onside;
  GK excluded as a receiver. In `resolvePossession`, the FIRST teammate to touch
  the played ball: if they're in `offsideFlags` → `callOffside(them)`; any other
  first touch (defender or onside mate) clears the flags (phase resolved).
  `callOffside` = FULL RESTART (user: "it should restart like FIFA, not keep
  playing"): ball stopped dead at the spot. Players KEEP their live positions
  (play stopped where it was) — we only zero momentum + face them upfield. The
  ONLY exception: the offending attacking team's players that are ahead of the
  ball get pulled BACK onside (x → spotX - atkDir*(28+ahead), preserving their
  y lane). NOTE: the earlier version teleported EVERYONE to anchor+shift which
  clamped them onto the far goal line (bug the user reported — "everyone at the
  goal line"); do NOT reintroduce a global shift. Nearest outfield defender is
  dropped on the ball as `owner` (and `controlled` if home defends, else control
  reverts to home's kickoff fwd); camera pans to the spot; "OFFSIDE" msg + 1.1s
  freeze; all transient state (stealProtect=1.2, marks, jostle, tackle/charge
  timers) reset. Flags also cleared in resetKickoff. Through/long balls/GK punts
  all funnel through afterKick, so all are policed.

### NOT YET BUILT (future slices)
- Fouls/free kicks/penalties. (Throw-ins, goal kicks and corners now exist —
  see OUT OF PLAY above; but they're simple ball-placements, no thrower animation
  or wall/setpiece routines.)
- Slide tackle, ball height (lobs/crosses/chips).
- Difficulty levels, player stats, persistence of results to a Store.

### 2. AVAILABLE UI COMPONENTS (SHADCN-STYLE)

All components are custom implementations located in `/user-app/src/client/components/ui/`:

#### Button Component (`/user-app/src/client/components/ui/Button.tsx`)
- **Variants**: default, destructive, outline, secondary, ghost, link
- **Sizes**: default, sm, lg, icon
- **Features**: Forward ref, fully styled with Tailwind, hover/active states
- **Props**: `ButtonProps extends React.ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement>`

#### Input Component (`/user-app/src/client/components/ui/Input.tsx`)
- **Features**: Forward ref, styled with Tailwind
- **Supports**: All standard HTML input attributes
- **Styling**: Border, focus ring, dark mode, placeholder colors

#### Label Component (`/user-app/src/client/components/ui/Label.tsx`)
- **Features**: Semantic label element with peer-disabled states
- **Props**: `LabelProps extends React.LabelHTMLAttributes<HTMLLabelElement>`

#### Card Component (`/user-app/src/client/components/ui/Card.tsx`)
- **Subcomponents**: 
  - `Card` - Main container
  - `CardHeader` - Header section with padding
  - `CardTitle` - Title text styling
  - `CardDescription` - Description text styling
  - `CardContent` - Content wrapper
  - `CardFooter` - Footer section

All components use the `cn()` utility function for class merging.

### 3. UTILITY FUNCTIONS

**File**: `/user-app/src/client/lib/utils.ts`

```typescript
export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs))
}
```
- Uses `clsx` for conditional classes
- Uses `tailwind-merge` to prevent class conflicts
- Perfect for merging component classes with custom overrides

### 4. EXISTING FORM PATTERNS

The app already has two working form examples you can reference:

#### LoginForm (`/user-app/src/client/pages/LoginPage.tsx`)
- Email and password fields
- `FormData` API for form submission
- Card-based layout with headers and footers
- Validation and error handling
- Links to signup

#### SignupForm (`/user-app/src/client/pages/SignupPage.tsx`)
- Email, password, confirm password
- Checkbox for terms acceptance
- Success state handling
- Client-side password validation
- Toast error notifications
- `useCallback` hook for form submission
- State management for success state

### 5. APP STRUCTURE & ARCHITECTURE

#### Client Setup (`/user-app/src/client/index.tsx`)
```typescript
- React Query (TanStack) integration
- React Router DOM
- React Hot Toast for notifications
- Suspense boundaries with loading state
- Global error handler
```

#### Router Configuration (`/user-app/src/client/router.tsx`)
- **Public Routes**: Home, Example, Terms, Logout, 404
- **Guest Routes**: Login, Signup (redirects to home if authenticated)
- **Private Routes**: PrivateExamplePage (redirects to login if not authenticated)
- **Route Protection**: 
  - `GuestRoute` component for auth-only pages
  - `PrivateRoute` component for protected pages
  - Redirect with `_redirect` query param to return after login

#### Page Wrapper (`/user-app/src/client/components/Page.tsx`)
- Header with a Home button (left) and either user handle + Logout or a Sign in button (right) — no logo
- Responsive layout with max-width
- Body section with optional loading state
- Accepts a `seo` prop (`{ title?, noindex? }`) that is forwarded to `<Seo />`
  to set the document `<title>` per page (see SEO/TITLE PATTERN below)

### 6. MODULE SYSTEM (Backend)

**File**: `/user-app/src/server/example/index.ts`

Example shows Module pattern with:

```typescript
new Module('example', {
  configSchema: { /* configuration */ },
  stores: [ /* database stores */ ],
  queries: {
    getItem: async (args, { user }) => { /* query logic */ },
    getItems: async (args, { user }) => { /* query logic */ }
  },
  mutations: {
    createItem: async (args, { user }) => { /* mutation logic */ },
    updateItem: async (args, { user }) => { /* mutation logic */ }
  },
  cronJobs: {
    dailyTest: dailyTestCron
  }
})
```

#### Database Pattern (`/user-app/src/server/example/db.ts`)
```typescript
export const dbExampleItems = new Store('exampleItems', {
  schema: {
    title: schema.string(),
    createdAt: schema.date(),
    userId: schema.userId(),
  },
  indexes: []
});
```

### 7. BUILD & DEVELOPMENT

**Scripts** (from package.json):
```bash
npm run dev          # Development server
npm run build        # Production build
npm start            # Start production server
npm test             # Run tests (not configured)
```

**Vite Configuration**:
- Root: `src/client`
- Path alias: `@/` → `./src/`
- Dev server: `0.0.0.0:5173` (allows external access)
- React plugin enabled

### 8. STYLING SETUP

- **Tailwind CSS v4** via the `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin. All Tailwind config
  is CSS-first in `src/client/index.css` (`@import "tailwindcss"`, `@theme`,
  `@source`, etc.) — customize the design system there.
- **Color Scheme**: PitchKick design system in `index.css @theme`. `night-950..600`
  = pitch-side darks for SURFACES/BORDERS/backgrounds ONLY (don't use as text —
  too dark on the near-black bg). `night-500..200` (#5d738c→#c6d2de) = readable
  muted SLATE TEXT tints; use `text-night-300` for default muted copy, `-400/-500`
  for dimmer secondary text. `volt-500/400/300` = electric-lime accent. Fixed
  after user reported gray-on-black text ("ARCADE FOOTBALL", hints, etc.) was
  near-invisible — all `text-night-600/700` were remapped to the 300/500 tints.

### 9. SEO (TITLE, DESCRIPTION, OG TAGS)

- `src/client/seo.config.ts` is the single source of truth for `siteName` and
  the site-wide meta `description`. **You MUST update both fields** as soon as
  the product name is known — they default to the literal string
  `"Empty Project"` and a generic placeholder description, both of which ship
  broken SEO and social previews. Update them on any landing-page task or
  product-rename request.
- `<Seo />` (in `src/client/components/Seo.tsx`) renders `<title>`, the meta
  description, and Open Graph / Twitter card tags from `seoConfig`. It is
  already mounted once at the app root in `src/client/index.tsx`, so every
  page inherits the site-wide defaults automatically.
- Per-page overrides: pass `seo` to `<Page />`, e.g.
  `<Page seo={{ title: 'Sign in' }}>` or
  `<Page seo={{ title: 'Pricing', description: '...' }}>`. Set
  `noindex: true` for auth, terms, and 404 pages.
- Rendered at runtime via React 19 native `<title>` / `<meta>` hoisting; no
  SEO library needed.
- Heading hierarchy: every page must have exactly one `<h1>` and headings
  must descend monotonically (`h1 → h2 → h3`, never skip a level). Skipped
  levels hurt accessibility audits and SEO.

### 10. REUSABLE PATTERNS FOR NEW FEATURES

When adding a new feature, reach for these existing building blocks before
introducing new ones:

1. **Forms**: native `FormData` API, mirroring `LoginPage` / `SignupPage`.
2. **Validation**: Zod on the server (inside module queries/mutations);
   lightweight client-side checks before submit.
3. **UI Components**: `Button`, `Input`, `Label`, `Card` from
   `src/client/components/ui/`. Avoid pulling in external UI libraries.
4. **Page Layout**: wrap routes in `<Page>` (sets header + `<title>` via
   the `seo` prop).
5. **Icons**: `lucide-react`.
6. **Toast Notifications**: `react-hot-toast` for user feedback.
7. **Server State**: `@tanstack/react-query` via `@modelence/react-query`
   helpers (`useQuery`, `useMutation`).
8. **Local State**: standard React hooks (`useState`, `useCallback`,
   `useMemo`, `useRef`). On React 19, prefer ref-as-prop over `forwardRef`
   in any new components.
9. **Styling**: Tailwind classes combined with the `cn()` helper from
   `src/client/lib/utils.ts`.
10. **Backend feature**: add a new `Module` under `src/server/<feature>/`
    following the `example` module shape (`configSchema`, `stores`,
    `queries`, `mutations`, optional `cronJobs`), and register it in
    `src/server/app.ts`.

### Summary

This is a full-stack Modelence framework application with:
- Clean component structure ready for new features
- All necessary UI building blocks already available
- Form handling patterns established
- Database and backend module patterns ready to follow
- Authentication system in place
- TypeScript support throughout
- No external shadcn/ui dependency needed — custom components are already implemented

### 11. MOBILE APP (Expo, optional)

A project may *optionally* include a mobile app alongside the web app. The
template ships an empty `mobile/` folder, but the studio treats the mobile
app as "not yet created" until the marker file
`mobile/.modelence-mobile-enabled` exists. The Mobile tab in the studio shows
a "Create mobile app" CTA in this state.

**Important rules**

- The studio's "Create mobile app" flow (button or matching free-text prompt)
  scaffolds/installs the Expo app and writes `mobile/.modelence-mobile-enabled`.
  Do NOT write that marker without first installing Expo dependencies — the
  studio assumes mobile is fully usable once the marker is present.
- The mobile app uses **Expo Router 4.x** (file-based routing). The entry
  point is `expo-router/entry` (set in `mobile/package.json`'s `"main"` field).
  Route groups: `(auth)` for unauthenticated screens, `(app)` for protected
  screens. The `RouteGuard` component in `app/_layout.tsx` redirects based on
  `useSession()` — unauthenticated → `/(auth)/sign-in`, authenticated →
  `/(app)/home`. Do not revert to a manual `registerRootComponent` + `App.tsx`
  setup.
- `index.ts` is a side-effect module (imported by `app/_layout.tsx`) that runs
  `configureClient` and rehydrates the auth token from AsyncStorage. It does
  NOT call `registerRootComponent`.
- Keep `mobile/`'s `package.json` and `node_modules` separate from the web
  app's. Metro and Vite cannot share the same dependency tree.
- The Studio sandbox runs `expo start --tunnel` automatically when the user
  opens the Mobile preview tab. **Do not** add a long-running Expo process
  to the root `package.json`'s `dev` script.
- The root `package.json` has a `postinstall` that runs
  `node scripts/postinstall.mjs`. That script re-installs mobile deps whenever
  the marker exists and no-ops otherwise. Do not remove either; do not change
  the script to run unconditionally.
- Optional convenience scripts you may add at the project root:
  `"dev:mobile": "cd mobile && npm run start"`.
- API calls from the mobile app to the Modelence backend should target the
  sandbox URL exposed in the studio preview (set via an env var the user
  configures in `mobile/app.json`'s `extra` field).
- When adding shared logic, prefer plain TypeScript modules under
  `src/shared/` and import them from both the web client and `mobile/App.tsx`.
  Avoid React-DOM-only or Node-only imports in shared code.
