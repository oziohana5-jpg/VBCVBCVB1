// tight up-and-over lob that the old M(46) (~4.7× real) forced on EVERY lofted
// ball. At M(18) a struck ball arcs over ~18–20m, so a typical shot is still
// RISING (or low and flat) as it reaches the goal instead of dropping into it.

// you can't just knock it past everyone and outrun the whole pitch to goal.
